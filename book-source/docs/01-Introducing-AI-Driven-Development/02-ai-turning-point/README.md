# Chapter 2: The AI Turning Point

In Chapter 1, you discovered a fundamental shift: you're no longer just a "coder." You're becoming an *orchestrator*—directing AI partners to do work alongside you.

Now the critical questions emerge: Is 2025 really different from 2024? How should you approach AI-assisted development? Why do some teams succeed with AI while others struggle? What tools should you use, and what risks must you navigate?

This chapter provides evidence-based answers, concrete frameworks, and practical guidance. Through five interconnected lessons, you'll discover why 2025 represents a genuine inflection point, understand the fundamental paradigm shift from user interfaces to user intent, distinguish between experimental "vibe coding" and disciplined Spec-Driven Development, learn what organizational capabilities predict AI success, and explore the modern three-layer AI development stack.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have the context, frameworks, and confidence to adopt AI-driven development thoughtfully—with discipline, not just speed.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:

- **The 2025 inflection point**: Three convergent trends (capability breakthroughs, mainstream adoption, enterprise productization) that make this year fundamentally different from previous AI waves
- **The UX→Intent paradigm shift**: How agentic AI transforms human-computer interaction from navigating interfaces to expressing intent, and the Five Powers (See, Hear, Reason, Act, Remember) that enable autonomous orchestration
- **Development patterns**: When experimental "vibe coding" is appropriate versus when Spec-Driven Development (SDD) is necessary, including the complete 7-step SDD workflow
- **Organizational readiness**: The "AI as amplifier" thesis and how to assess your team's readiness across the seven DORA capabilities that predict AI development success
- **The modern AI development stack**: The three-layer architecture (Frontier Models, AI-First IDEs, Development Agents) and how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) prevents vendor lock-in
