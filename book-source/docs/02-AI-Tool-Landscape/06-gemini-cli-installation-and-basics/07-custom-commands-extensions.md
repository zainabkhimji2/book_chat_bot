# Custom Commands & Extensions: Extending Gemini CLI

## Introduction: Building Your Own Toolset

By now, you've learned:
- **Slash commands** (`/memory`, `/stats`, `/mcp`) for orchestration
- **GEMINI.md** for project context
- **Memory checkpoints** for conversation persistence
- **MCP servers** for external integrations

Now it's time to create your own commands and install capability bundles that package everything together.

---

## Custom Slash Commands: Creating Your Own

### Why Custom Commands?

Imagine repeating the same multi-step workflow daily:

```
Without custom command (manual):
1. /mcp list
2. Ask Gemini to research competitor prices
3. Ask Gemini to summarize
4. /memory save results
(5 minutes, multiple steps)

With custom command:
/research competitors
(30 seconds, one command)
```

Custom commands automate repeated patterns.

---

## TOML Command Syntax

Gemini CLI uses **TOML** (simple configuration format) for custom commands.

### Basic Structure

```toml
# File path determines command name.
# ~/.gemini/commands/research.toml -> /research
description = "Research a topic using web browsing"
prompt = "Search the web for {{query}} and summarize findings in 5 bullet points"
```

### With Variables

```toml
# ~/.gemini/commands/research.toml -> /research
description = "Research a topic"
prompt = """
Using the Playwright MCP server, research {{topic}}.
Look for:
- Current trends
- Key players
- Market size
- Challenges
Summarize in a structured report.
"""
```

### With Shell Integration

```toml
# ~/.gemini/commands/audit-code.toml -> /audit-code
description = "Security audit of your code"
prompt = """
These are my TypeScript files:

!{find src -name '*.ts' -type f}

Perform a security audit and list vulnerabilities.
"""
```

---

## Command Naming: Derived From File Path

- User commands live in `~/.gemini/commands/`
  - `~/.gemini/commands/test.toml` -> `/test`
  - `~/.gemini/commands/git/commit.toml` -> `/git:commit`
- Project commands live in `./gemini/commands/`
  - `./gemini/commands/spec.toml` -> `/spec`

No `[command]` table or `name` field is required; the command name is inferred from the TOML file path.

---

## Two Levels: User vs. Project Commands

### User Commands (~/.gemini/commands/)

**For:** Personal workflow patterns you use across projects

**Examples:**
- `/research` — Search and summarize
- `/brainstorm` — Creative ideation
- `/code-review` — Review code patterns
- `/architecture` — Architecture discussion

**Setup:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/commands/
# Create command files here
```

### Project Commands (./gemini/commands/)

**For:** Project-specific workflows unique to this codebase

**Examples:**
- `/spec` — Generate API specification
- `/test-strategy` — Suggest test approach
- `/refactor-proposal` — Suggest refactorings
- `/migration-plan` — Plan database migration

**Setup:**
```bash
mkdir -p ./gemini/commands/
# Create command files here (committed to Git)
```

---

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Research Command

```toml
# ~/.gemini/commands/research.toml  -> /research
description = "Research a topic using web browsing"
prompt = """
Using the Context7 MCP server, research the following topic: {{topic}}

Please provide:
1. Summary of current state
2. Key trends
3. Recent developments (last 6 months)
4. Key players/companies
5. Recommended resources

Format as structured markdown.
"""
```

**Usage:**
```
/research AI safety regulations in Europe
```

### Example 2: Code Review Command

```toml
# ./gemini/commands/code-review.toml  -> /code-review
description = "Review code in project for patterns"
prompt = """
Review @src/{{path}}.

Check for:
- Security issues
- Performance problems
- Maintainability
- Testing coverage
- Best practices

Format as:
## Security
## Performance
## Maintainability
## Testing
## Best Practices
"""
```

**Usage:**
```
/code-review routes/auth.ts
```

---

## Extensions: Bundled Capabilities

### What Is an Extension?

An **extension** packages:
- Custom commands (TOML files)
- MCP server configurations
- GEMINI.md context snippets
- Settings overrides

Into a shareable, installable bundle.

### How Extensions Work

**Install:**
```
gemini extensions install <source> [--ref <ref>] [--auto-update] [--pre-release] [--consent] [--scope <user|workspace>]
```

Gemini CLI downloads and installs:
- 5+ custom commands (bundled)
- 2 MCP servers (preconfigured)
- Best practices (GEMINI.md)
- Settings (model, token limits, etc.)

**Result:** You get a complete workflow setup in one command.

---

## Example: Installing an Online Extension

Up-to-date code docs for any prompt

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/upstash/context7
```

After installation, check available commands:

```bash
gemini extensions list
```

The extensions listed here are sourced from public repositories and created by third-party developers. Google does not vet, endorse, or guarantee the functionality or security of these extensions. Please carefully inspect any extension and its source code before installing to understand the permissions it requires and the actions it may perform.

---

## Security Evaluation Framework

Before installing an extension, evaluate:

### 1. Code Review
- ✅ Is source available on GitHub?
- ✅ Can you review the commands?
- ✅ Do they do what they claim?

### 2. Permission Review
- ✅ What files can it access?
- ✅ What external services does it use?
- ✅ Does it need your API keys?

### 3. Network Activity
- ✅ Does it send data externally?
- ✅ Is it encrypted?
- ✅ Can you see the requests?

### 4. Data Handling
- ✅ Does it log conversations?
- ✅ Does it cache your code?
- ✅ How long is data retained?

### 5. Author Reputation
- ✅ Who maintains it?
- ✅ How active is development?
- ✅ Community feedback?

### 6. Community Trust
- ✅ GitHub stars/downloads
- ✅ Reviews and ratings
- ✅ Issue resolution rate

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create a User Command

Create your first custom command:

**Step 1:** Create command file
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/commands/
touch ~/.gemini/commands/hello.toml
```

**Step 2:** Add content
```toml
# ~/.gemini/commands/hello.toml -> /hello
description = "Greet me with context about my work"
prompt = "Greet me warmly and remind me that I'm building {{project}}, focusing on {{goal}}."
```

**Step 3:** Use it
```
/hello project=my-api goal=security
```

### Exercise 2: Create a Project Command

**Step 1:** Create in project
```bash
mkdir -p ./gemini/commands/
touch ./gemini/commands/spec.toml
```

**Step 2:** Add content
```toml
# ./gemini/commands/spec.toml -> /spec
description = "Generate API spec from code"
prompt = "Looking at my code, generate an OpenAPI specification for my {{endpoint}} endpoint."
```

**Step 3:** Use it
```
/spec endpoint=users
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO

- ✅ Name commands after their function (`/research`, `/review`, `/spec`)
- ✅ Use descriptive descriptions
- ✅ Include variables for flexibility (`{{topic}}`, `{{path}}`)
- ✅ Test locally before sharing
- ✅ Document what the command does
- ✅ Review extensions before installing

### ❌ DON'T

- ❌ Don't create commands that duplicate slash commands
- ❌ Don't hardcode project-specific paths in user commands
- ❌ Don't trust unreviewed extensions
- ❌ Don't install extensions with unclear permissions
- ❌ Don't share commands with hardcoded secrets

---
