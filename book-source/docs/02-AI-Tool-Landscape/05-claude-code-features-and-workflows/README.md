# Chapter 5: How It All Started — The Claude Code Phenomenon

You know *why* AI-driven development matters—and that it's happening right now, in 2025.But understanding transformation and experiencing it are two different things. 

This chapter introduces you to the first real tool you'll use: Claude Code. Not as abstract theory, but as a working development partner on your machine.

Through eight interconnected lessons—from origin story through installation, commands, subagents, skills, MCP integration, hooks, and plugins—you'll move from passive understanding to active collaboration. You'll install Claude Code, set up collaborative partners (subagents and skills), integrate external systems (MCP), automate with hooks, and compose complete workflows (plugins).

The goal is **not to build a supercomputer**, but to establish Claude Code as your **collaborative thinking partner** for everything.

This is where theory becomes practice.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:

- **The paradigm shift from passive to agentic AI**: How Claude Code differs fundamentally from chat-based AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) by taking autonomous action—reading files, running commands, managing projects—not just suggesting code snippets
- **Installation and authentication on any platform**: Complete setup process for Windows, macOS, or Linux with platform-specific instructions.
- **Custom subagents for specialized tasks**: How to create focused AI assistants with specialized instructions and how specialized context prevents the "drift" problem in long conversations
- **Agent Skills for autonomous discovery**: Building custom skills that Claude Code discovers and invokes automatically based on task context, understanding how skill libraries amplify your team's domain expertise, and the competitive advantage of encoding institutional knowledge as discoverable skills
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) for external integration**: Connecting Claude Code to external data sources safely and securely
- **Hooks & automation triggers**: Creating PreToolUse, PostToolUse, and SessionStart hooks to automate actions before and after Claude Code tool execution
- **Plugins as composition**: Understanding how plugins package commands, agents, skills, and hooks into complete, shareable workflows
- **Your workflow transformation**: Transitioning from passive tool user to active AI orchestrator, establishing habits for effective AI collaboration, and recognizing when Claude Code amplifies productivity versus when simpler tools suffice
