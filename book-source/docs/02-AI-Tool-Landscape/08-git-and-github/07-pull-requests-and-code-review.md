# Pull Requests and Code Review

You tested changes on your branch. Everything works! Now what?

**Bad approach**: Just merge to main and hope.

**Professional approach**: Create a Pull Request (PR) - final safety check before merging.

**Time**: 20 minutes

---

## What Is a Pull Request?

A **Pull Request** says: "I'm done with these changes. Please review before merging to main."

**Simple flow**:

```
Branch (your changes) → Pull Request → Review → Merge to Main
```

**Why this matters**:
- Last review chance before merging
- Shows exactly what changed (diff view)
- Documents why you made changes
- Professional workflow
- Transparent about AI assistance

---

## The PR Workflow

### Step 1: Push Your Branch to GitHub

Get your branch from local computer to GitHub.

**You ask Gemini CLI**: "Push my 'add-calculator' branch to GitHub"

Gemini runs: `git push -u origin add-calculator`

Branch uploads to GitHub.

**Check it worked**: Visit your repository on GitHub - you'll see a yellow banner about recent pushes.

---

### Step 2: Create Pull Request on GitHub

**On GitHub website**:

1. Look for yellow banner: "add-calculator had recent pushes"
2. Click green **"Compare & pull request"** button
3. You'll see the PR creation form

**OR**:

1. Click "Pull requests" tab
2. Click green "New pull request" button
3. Select your branch from dropdown

---

### Step 3: Write PR Description

**What to include**:

**Title** (short summary):
- Example: "Add calculator module"
- Keep it 5-10 words

**Description** (answer 3 questions):

1. **What changed?**
   - List main changes
   - Be specific

2. **What did AI do?**
   - Document AI's role
   - Be transparent

3. **How to test?**
   - Give simple steps
   - Anyone should be able to verify

---

**Example PR description**:

```markdown
## What Changed
Added calculator module with 4 functions:
- add() - adds two numbers
- subtract() - subtracts two numbers
- multiply() - multiplies two numbers
- divide() - handles division by zero

## AI Assistance
- Gemini CLI generated all 4 functions
- Created unit tests (8 tests)
- Added error handling for edge cases
- Fixed bugs during testing phase

## How to Test
Run: `python test_calculator.py`
Expected: All 8 tests pass
```

**You ask Gemini CLI**: "Help me write a PR description for my calculator changes"

Gemini will generate a template based on your commits and changes.

---

### Step 4: Review the Diff

GitHub shows a **diff** (difference view):

- **Green lines** (+): Code added
- **Red lines** (-): Code removed
- **Gray lines**: Context (unchanged)

**Check**:
- Does the diff look correct?
- Any unintended changes?
- All files you meant to include?

---

### Step 5: Create the PR

Click **"Create Pull Request"** button.

PR is now live! Anyone can:
- See your changes
- Leave comments
- Approve or request changes

---

## Handling Feedback

Someone leaves a comment: "Add better error messages"

**To update your PR**:

1. Make changes locally on your branch
2. Commit the changes:

**Ask Gemini CLI**: "Commit my improvements with message 'Add better error messages'"

Gemini runs: `git commit -m "Add better error messages"`

3. Push to GitHub:

**Ask Gemini CLI**: "Push my updates to GitHub"

Gemini runs: `git push`

**PR automatically updates** with your new commits. No need to create a new PR.

---

## Merging the Pull Request

**When to merge**:
- All tests pass
- You've reviewed the changes
- Any feedback is addressed
- (In teams: after approval from reviewers)

**On GitHub**:

1. Go to your PR page
2. Click green **"Merge pull request"** button
3. Click **"Confirm merge"**

Done! Changes are now in `main`.

---

## After Merging: Clean Up

**Delete the branch on GitHub**:

GitHub shows "Delete branch" button after merge - click it.

**Delete the branch locally**:

**You ask Gemini CLI**: "Delete my local 'add-calculator' branch"

Gemini runs:
1. `git checkout main` (switch to main)
2. `git pull` (get the merged changes)
3. `git branch -d add-calculator` (delete local branch)

Your workspace is clean!

---

## Complete Example

**You**: "I finished my calculator. Write a professional PR description."

**You ask Gemini CLI**: "Generate a PR description for my calculator changes"

Gemini creates:

```markdown
## Add Calculator Module

### Changes
- Created calculator.py with 4 operations
- Added comprehensive test suite
- Implemented error handling for division by zero

### AI Assistance
- Generated initial function implementations
- Created unit test framework
- Suggested error handling patterns
- Fixed edge case bugs

### Testing
Run: `python test_calculator.py`
All 8 tests should pass

### Files Changed
- calculator.py (new)
- test_calculator.py (new)
- README.md (updated usage instructions)
```

Copy this into GitHub's PR description field.

## Good vs Bad PR Descriptions

**Bad** ❌:
- Title: "stuff"
- Description: "added things"
- No mention of AI
- No test instructions

**Good** ✅:
- Title: "Add calculator module"
- Description: Lists changes, AI role, testing steps
- Clear and professional
- Anyone can understand what happened

---

## Key Commands Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Push branch to GitHub | `git push -u origin branch-name` |
| Push updates to PR | `git push` (while on branch) |
| Switch to main | `git checkout main` |
| Pull merged changes | `git pull` |
| Delete local branch | `git branch -d branch-name` |
| Force delete branch | `git branch -D branch-name` |

Most PR actions happen on GitHub website (create, merge, comment).

---

## Safety Guidelines

**Always**:
- Test before creating PR
- Write clear descriptions
- Document AI assistance
- Review the diff before creating
- Clean up branches after merge

**Never**:
- Merge PRs with failing tests
- Leave vague descriptions
- Hide AI's role
- Merge without reviewing changes
- Keep old branches forever

---

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Vague Titles**
- Bad: "Update"
- Good: "Add calculator with 4 operations"

**Mistake 2: No AI Documentation**
- Bad: Silent about AI help
- Good: "AI generated functions, I tested and reviewed"

**Mistake 3: Merging Too Fast**
- Bad: Create PR, immediately merge (no review)
- Good: Create PR, review diff, test, then merge

**Mistake 4: Not Cleaning Up**
- Bad: 20 old merged branches cluttering your repo
- Good: Delete branches after merge

---

## Try With AI

Practice the PR workflow.

**Tool**: Gemini CLI (or Claude Code, ChatGPT)

### Exercise 1: Create Your First PR

```
I have a branch "add-calculator" pushed to GitHub.
Walk me through creating a Pull Request:
1. Where do I click on GitHub?
2. What do I write in title and description?
3. How do I submit it?
```

### Exercise 2: Write Professional Description

```
Generate a PR description for:
- Calculator with add, subtract, multiply, divide
- AI generated all code
- 8 tests, all passing

Make it professional but simple.
```

### Exercise 3: Update a PR

```
Someone commented: "Add input validation"
Guide me through:
1. Making the changes locally
2. Committing them
3. Updating the PR on GitHub
```

### Exercise 4: Merge and Clean Up

```
My PR is approved! Help me:
1. Merge it on GitHub
2. Delete the remote branch
3. Delete my local branch
4. Get the merged changes locally
```

### Exercise 5: Review Process

```
Explain what happens when:
1. I push a branch to GitHub
2. I create a PR from that branch
3. I push more commits to the same branch
4. I merge the PR

Does the PR update automatically?
```
