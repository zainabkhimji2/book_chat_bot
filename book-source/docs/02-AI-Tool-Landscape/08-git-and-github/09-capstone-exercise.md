# Capstone: Build Your First Project

You've learned Git piece by piece. Now use EVERYTHING together to build a real project.

**The project**: Python calculator
**Who writes code**: AI (Gemini CLI)
**Your job**: Manage Git, make decisions, review AI's work

**Time**: 30 minutes

---

## What You'll Use

Build a calculator project using:
- ✅ Git (track changes)
- ✅ Branches (test safely)
- ✅ GitHub (backup online)
- ✅ Pull Requests (professional workflow)
- ✅ AI (generates all code)

**Important**: You're not learning Python. You're learning to MANAGE a project with Git while AI writes code.

---

## The Professional Workflow

```
1. Init project + first commit
   ↓
2. AI generates code → review → commit
   ↓
3. Create branch → AI adds feature → test → merge
   ↓
4. Push to GitHub
   ↓
5. Create Pull Request → review → merge
   ↓
6. Professional portfolio project!
```

---

## Step 1: Initialize Project

**What you're doing**: Create folder, start Git, make first commit

**You ask Gemini CLI**:

```
Create a folder called 'my-calculator'.
Navigate into it.
Initialize Git.
Create a README.md saying "Calculator Project".
Commit with message 'Initial project setup'.
```

Gemini runs:
```bash
mkdir my-calculator
cd my-calculator
git init
echo "# Calculator Project" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
```

**Check it worked**:

**Ask Gemini CLI**: "Show me the commit history"

Gemini runs: `git log --oneline`

You should see: `Initial project setup`

---

## Step 2: Generate Calculator Code

**What you're doing**: AI writes calculator, you review and commit

**You ask Gemini CLI**:

```
Create calculator.py with these functions:
- add(a, b) - adds two numbers
- subtract(a, b) - subtracts two numbers
- multiply(a, b) - multiplies two numbers
- divide(a, b) - divides with zero-check

Show me the code first.
```

Gemini shows you:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return 'Error: Cannot divide by zero'
    return a / b
```

**Review the code**:
- Does it have all 4 functions? ✓
- Does divide() handle zero? ✓
- Do you understand what it does? ✓

**You**: "Looks good. Save this file and commit it with message 'Add calculator module'."

Gemini runs:
```bash
# (saves calculator.py)
git add calculator.py
git commit -m "Add calculator module"
```

**Check it worked**:

**Ask Gemini CLI**: "Show me my commits"

You should see:
```
Add calculator module
Initial project setup
```

---

## Step 3: Test Changes on Branch

**What you're doing**: Create branch, add tests, verify safely

**You ask Gemini CLI**:

```
Create a branch called 'add-tests'.
Generate pytest tests for calculator.py.
Save to test_calculator.py.
Show me the tests first.
```

Gemini runs: `git checkout -b add-tests`

Then shows you the tests:

```python
import pytest
from calculator import add, subtract, multiply, divide

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5

def test_subtract():
    assert subtract(5, 3) == 2

def test_multiply():
    assert multiply(4, 3) == 12

def test_divide():
    assert divide(10, 2) == 5

def test_divide_by_zero():
    assert divide(10, 0) == 'Error: Cannot divide by zero'
```

**Review the tests**:
- Tests all 4 functions? ✓
- Tests division by zero? ✓

**You**: "Good. Save and commit with message 'Add unit tests'."

Gemini runs:
```bash
# (saves test_calculator.py)
git add test_calculator.py
git commit -m "Add unit tests"
```

**Check branch status**:

**Ask Gemini CLI**: "Which branch am I on? Show me what's different from main."

Gemini runs:
- `git branch --show-current` → shows `add-tests`
- `git diff main` → shows test_calculator.py added

---

## Step 4: Test and Merge

**What you're doing**: Run tests, if pass → merge, if fail → fix

**You ask Gemini CLI**:

```
Run the tests using pytest.
If all tests pass, merge this branch to main.
If tests fail, tell me what broke.
```

Gemini runs: `pytest test_calculator.py`

Output:
```
====== test session starts ======
test_calculator.py .....     [100%]

====== 5 passed in 0.12s ======
```

All tests pass! ✓

**You**: "Merge to main and delete the branch."

Gemini runs:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge add-tests
git branch -d add-tests
```

**Check it worked**:

**Ask Gemini CLI**: "Show me my commit history and current branch"

You should see:
- Branch: `main`
- Commits: Add unit tests, Add calculator module, Initial project setup

---

## Step 5: Push to GitHub

**What you're doing**: Backup code to GitHub

### Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to github.com
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name: `my-calculator`
4. Public
5. Don't initialize (you already have code)
6. Create repository
7. Copy the URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/my-calculator.git`)

### Connect and Push

**You ask Gemini CLI**: "Connect to GitHub repo [paste URL] and push my code"

Gemini runs:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my-calculator.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

GitHub will ask for authentication:
- Username: your GitHub username
- Password: your Personal Access Token

**Check it worked**:

Visit `github.com/username/my-calculator` in browser.

You should see:
- README.md
- calculator.py
- test_calculator.py
- All 3 commits

---

## Step 6: Create Pull Request

**What you're doing**: Add feature using professional PR workflow

**You ask Gemini CLI**:

```
Create a branch called 'improve-docs'.
Add docstrings to all functions in calculator.py.
Show me the updated code.
```

Gemini runs: `git checkout -b improve-docs`

Then shows updated code:

```python
def add(a, b):
    """Add two numbers and return the result."""
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    """Subtract b from a and return the result."""
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    """Multiply two numbers and return the result."""
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    """
    Divide a by b and return the result.
    Returns error message if b is zero.
    """
    if b == 0:
        return 'Error: Cannot divide by zero'
    return a / b
```

**You**: "Looks good. Commit with message 'Add function docstrings' and push to GitHub."

Gemini runs:
```bash
git add calculator.py
git commit -m "Add function docstrings"
git push -u origin improve-docs
```

### Create PR on GitHub

1. Go to `github.com/username/my-calculator`
2. Yellow banner appears: "improve-docs had recent pushes"
3. Click "Compare & pull request"
4. Title: "Improve documentation"
5. Description:

```markdown
## Changes
Added docstrings to all calculator functions

## AI Assistance
Gemini CLI generated the docstrings

## Testing
All existing tests still pass
```

6. Click "Create pull request"

### Merge the PR

1. Review the diff on GitHub
2. Click "Merge pull request"
3. Click "Confirm merge"
4. Click "Delete branch" (on GitHub)

### Pull Changes Locally

**You ask Gemini CLI**: "Pull the merged changes and delete local branch"

Gemini runs:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git branch -d improve-docs
```

**Check it worked**:

**Ask Gemini CLI**: "Show me current branch and latest commit"

Should show:
- Branch: `main`
- Latest commit: "Add function docstrings"
