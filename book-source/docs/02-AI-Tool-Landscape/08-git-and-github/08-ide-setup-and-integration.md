# IDE Setup and Integration

Typing Git commands every time is slow. You can't see your changes visually.

**Solution**: An IDE - code editor with Git built in, plus AI help.

**Time**: 20 minutes

---

## What Is an IDE?

**IDE** = Integrated Development Environment (fancy code editor)

**Simple explanation**:
- Regular text editor = just typing
- IDE = typing + Git + file explorer + AI + everything in one place

**Why this matters**:
- See Git changes with colors (green = added, red = removed)
- Click buttons instead of typing commands
- AI suggests code as you type
- Everything integrated

---

## Your Three Choices

Pick **ONE**. Don't install all three.

| IDE | Why Choose It | Download |
|-----|---------------|----------|
| **VS Code** | Most popular, easiest to learn | code.visualstudio.com |
| **Cursor** | Built-in AI (Claude, GPT-4) | cursor.sh |
| **Zed** | Super fast, minimal | zed.dev |

**Recommendation**: **VS Code** (most tutorials/help available) or **Cursor** (AI built-in).

---

## Step 1: Install Your IDE

### VS Code Installation

**Windows**:
1. Go to code.visualstudio.com
2. Click "Download for Windows"
3. Run the installer
4. Check "Add to PATH" option
5. Click Finish

**Mac**:
1. Go to code.visualstudio.com
2. Download for macOS
3. Drag to Applications folder
4. Open from Applications

**Linux**:

**You ask Gemini CLI**: "How do I install VS Code on [your distribution]?"

Gemini provides the right package manager command.

---

**Verify installation**:

Open VS Code. You should see:
- Welcome screen
- Blue sidebar on left
- Menu bar at top

✓ If you see this, installation succeeded.

**If VS Code won't open**:

**Ask Gemini CLI**: "VS Code won't launch on [your OS]. Here's the error: [paste error]"

---

## Step 2: Open Your Git Project

**In VS Code**:

1. Click **File → Open Folder** (or Ctrl+K Ctrl+O)
2. Navigate to your Git project folder
3. Click "Select Folder"

Your project opens with files listed in the left sidebar.

**Verify it's a Git project**:

Look at bottom-left corner - you should see your branch name (e.g., "main").

**If no branch name appears**:

The folder might not have Git initialized.

**Ask Gemini CLI**: "Initialize Git in my current folder"

Gemini runs: `git init`

Reload VS Code - branch name should appear.

---

## Step 3: Find the Source Control Panel

**Where**: Click the branch icon (3rd icon) in left sidebar

**OR**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+G` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+G` (Mac)

**What you see**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ SOURCE CONTROL              │
│ ┌─────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ main ▼                  │ │ ← Current branch
│ └─────────────────────────┘ │
│                             │
│ Changes (2)                 │ ← Modified files
│ □ calculator.py         M   │
│ □ README.md            M    │
│                             │
│ ┌─────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ Message (Ctrl+Enter)    │ │ ← Commit message
│ └─────────────────────────┘ │
│ ✓ Commit                    │ ← Commit button
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**What the symbols mean**:
- **M** = Modified
- **A** = Added (new file)
- **D** = Deleted
- **U** = Untracked (Git doesn't know about it yet)

---

## Step 4: Stage and Commit Using GUI

**Traditional way**: `git add file` then `git commit -m "message"`

**IDE way** (visual):

1. **See what changed**:
   - Look at Source Control panel
   - Files with changes are listed

2. **Stage files** (prepare to commit):
   - Hover over filename
   - Click the **+** icon

   *(Equivalent to: `git add filename`)*

3. **Write commit message**:
   - Type in the message box
   - Be clear and specific

4. **Commit**:
   - Click the **✓ checkmark** above message box
   - Or press `Ctrl+Enter`

   *(Equivalent to: `git commit -m "your message"`)*

---

**View what changed before staging**:

Click the filename in Source Control panel.

A diff view opens:
- **Red**: Lines removed
- **Green**: Lines added
- **White**: Context (unchanged)

Always review before committing.

---

## Step 5: Push to GitHub from IDE

**After committing**:

1. Click the **...** menu (three dots in Source Control panel)
2. Select **Push**

*(Equivalent to: `git push`)*

**First time?**

If asked to authenticate, enter your GitHub username and Personal Access Token.

**Verify it worked**:

Visit your GitHub repository - your commit should appear.

---

## IDE Git Operations Reference

Replace command-line with GUI clicks:

| Task | Command Line | IDE Action |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| See what changed | `git status` | Open Source Control panel |
| View file diff | `git diff filename` | Click filename in panel |
| Stage file | `git add filename` | Click **+** next to file |
| Stage all files | `git add .` | Click **+** next to "Changes" |
| Commit | `git commit -m "msg"` | Type message, click ✓ |
| Push to GitHub | `git push` | Click **...** → Push |
| Pull from GitHub | `git pull` | Click **...** → Pull |
| Create branch | `git checkout -b name` | Click branch name (bottom-left) → New Branch |
| Switch branch | `git checkout name` | Click branch name → Select branch |
| View commit history | `git log` | Install GitLens extension (optional) |

---

## Step 6: Install AI Coding Assistant (Optional)

Get AI code suggestions as you type.

### Option 1: GitHub Copilot (Recommended)

**Cost**: $10/month (free for students with GitHub Student Pack)

**Install**:

1. Click **Extensions** icon (4 squares in left sidebar)
2. Search "GitHub Copilot"
3. Click "Install"
4. Click "Sign in to GitHub"
5. Authorize in browser
6. Reload VS Code

**Test it works**:

Type a comment: `# function to add two numbers`

Copilot suggests code in gray text. Press `Tab` to accept.

---

### Option 2: Cursor (Built-in AI)

If you installed Cursor IDE instead of VS Code:

AI is already built-in. Press `Ctrl+K` to open AI chat.

---

### Option 3: Continue (Free)

**Install**:

1. Extensions → Search "Continue"
2. Install
3. Configure with your AI API key (Gemini, Claude, GPT)

---

## Visual Workflow Example

**Traditional workflow** (command line):
```bash
$ git status
$ git diff calculator.py
$ git add calculator.py
$ git commit -m "Add calculator functions"
$ git push
```

**IDE workflow** (visual):

1. Open Source Control (1 click)
2. Click `calculator.py` to see diff
3. Click **+** to stage
4. Type message "Add calculator functions"
5. Click ✓ to commit
6. Click **...** → Push

Same result, more visual, easier to understand.

---

## Safety Tips

**Always**:
- Review the diff before staging
- Read what you're committing
- Write clear commit messages
- Check which branch you're on (bottom-left)

**Never**:
- Commit without reviewing changes
- Stage files you don't understand
- Ignore red errors in your IDE
- Commit to main without testing

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"Git not found"**:
- Install Git first (see Lesson 2)
- Restart VS Code after installing

**"No repository found"**:
- Make sure folder has `.git` directory
- Ask Gemini: "Initialize Git here"

**"Authentication failed" when pushing**:
- Use Personal Access Token, not password
- Create new token on GitHub if needed

**Copilot not suggesting**:
- Check you're signed in (bottom-right status bar)
- Make sure subscription is active
- Reload VS Code

## Try With AI

Practice using your IDE.

**Tool**: Gemini CLI (or Claude Code, ChatGPT)

### Exercise 1: Install and Setup

```
Guide me through:
1. Installing VS Code
2. Opening my project folder
3. Finding the Source Control panel
4. Explaining what I'm looking at
```

### Exercise 2: First GUI Commit

```
I edited README.md in my IDE.
Walk me through committing it using only the GUI:
- Where do I click?
- What do I type?
- How do I know it worked?
```

### Exercise 3: View Diff

```
How do I see exactly what changed in a file
before I commit it? Show me the diff view.
```

### Exercise 4: Install AI Extension

```
I want GitHub Copilot.
Walk me through:
1. Installing the extension
2. Signing in
3. Testing it works
```

### Exercise 5: IDE vs Command Line

```
Explain the difference between:
1. Typing "git add ." in terminal
2. Clicking the + button in VS Code

Are they doing the same thing?
```
