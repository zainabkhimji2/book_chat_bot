# Understanding Configuration and Secrets Safely

## Passwords Should Never Go In Your Code

Imagine giving your front door key to a locksmith who puts it in a labeled envelope on your doorstep: "Smith Family House Key—Keep This Safe!" That's what happens when you hardcode passwords or API keys in your code. If someone gets your code, they get your secrets.

This lesson teaches you how to keep secrets safe. Configuration (like API keys, database passwords, and tokens) should live in environment variables or configuration files, never in code.

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
1. **Understand temporary configuration** (export commands that last while terminal is open)
2. **Understand persistent configuration** (settings that survive closing the terminal)
3. **Never hardcode secrets** into your code (security mindset)

## Use `export` to Set Temporary Configuration

The `export` command sets a variable in your terminal session temporarily. It's useful for testing values without storing them in files.

### Example 1: Set a Temporary Variable

**Step 1: You Try It**

In your terminal, set a temporary variable:

```bash
$ export TEST_VALUE="hello-world"
$ echo $TEST_VALUE
hello-world
```

You've set `TEST_VALUE` temporarily. It exists only in this terminal session. When you close the terminal, it's gone.

**What to notice**: You used `export` to set a variable. The `$` symbol retrieves its value. It's temporary—only for this session.

### Step 2: Your AI Does the Same

Ask your AI:

**Prompt:**
```
Set a temporary environment variable using export.
Show me how to verify it's set using echo $VARIABLE_NAME.
Then explain: What happens to this variable when the terminal closes?
```

**Expected AI Output:**
```
$ export MY_VARIABLE="test-123"
$ echo $MY_VARIABLE
test-123
```

Your AI uses `export` the same way you did.

### Step 3: Compare and Understand

**Your command**: `export TEST_VALUE="hello-world"`
**AI's command**: `export MY_VARIABLE="test-123"`

Both set temporary variables. Both verified with `echo $`. Both will disappear when the terminal closes.

**Key insight**: Temporary variables are useful for testing but disappear when you exit the terminal.

## Use `.env` Files to Store Persistent Configuration

.env files (environment files) are text files that store configuration values. They persist across terminal restarts, unlike `export` which is temporary.

**Step 1: You Try It**

Create a simple configuration file:

```bash
$ echo "MY_API_KEY=test-key-12345" > .env
$ cat .env
MY_API_KEY=test-key-12345
```

You've created a `.env` file with a configuration value. This file persists—it survives terminal restarts.

**What to notice**: You created a file called `.env` with configuration. The file stays even after you close the terminal. Your code can read from it.

### Step 2: Your AI Does the Same

Ask your AI:

**Prompt:**
```
Create a .env file with configuration values.
Show the commands to create and verify the file.
Explain: Why is a .env file better than export for persistent configuration?
```

**Expected AI Output:**
```
$ cat > .env << 'EOF'
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/db
API_KEY=sk-test-key-12345
EOF

$ cat .env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/db
API_KEY=sk-test-key-12345
```

Your AI uses file creation the same way you did.

### Step 3: Compare and Understand

**Your approach**: Create `.env` file with `echo` or editor
**AI's approach**: Create `.env` file with `cat` command

Both create persistent configuration files. Both can be read by code. Both survive terminal restarts.

**Key insight**: .env files persist, unlike `export` which is temporary.

## Why Hardcoding Secrets Is Dangerous

**Bad code** (NEVER DO THIS):
```python
# DANGEROUS! Never hardcode secrets!
API_KEY = "sk-abc123def456ghi789"
DATABASE_PASSWORD = "MySecretPassword123"
```

If this code reaches GitHub, anyone with access to your repository gets your secrets. They can use them to access your accounts and systems.

**Good code** (DO THIS):
```python
import os
api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY')  # Read from environment, not hardcoded
```

Secrets come from environment variables or .env files—never from code itself.

## Try With AI: Side-by-Side Configuration Comparison

Now that you've set temporary and persistent configuration, compare what your AI does.

### Comparison Prompt

Open your AI tool and ask:

**Prompt:**
```
Let's practice safe configuration.
1. Set a temporary variable using export
2. Verify it with echo $VARIABLE
3. Explain why this is temporary (what happens when I close the terminal?)
4. Show how a .env file would be different
```

**What to Compare**:

| Approach | You Do This | Your AI Does This |
|---|---|---|
| Temporary (export) | `export TEST="value"` | (AI's export command) |
| Verify it | `echo $TEST` | (AI verifies) |
| Persistent (.env) | Create .env file | (AI creates .env file) |

**Observation**:
- Are the commands the same pattern? (Yes—both use environment variables)
- What's the main difference? (One is temporary, one is persistent)
- Why use .env for secrets? (Survives terminal restarts, easier to manage)

**Key Insight**: Both temporary and persistent approaches keep secrets out of code. The difference is how long they last.

## Try With AI: Security Best Practices

Ask your AI:

**Prompt:**
```
I'm about to use an API key in my project.
What's the safest way to handle it?
Show me:
1. Wrong way (what NOT to do)
2. Right way (using .env or export)
3. How to verify it's set correctly
4. How to make sure .env never gets committed to GitHub
```

**Expected Response**:
Your AI will explain:
1. Never hardcode secrets in code
2. Always read from environment or .env
3. Use `echo $VARIABLE` or test scripts to verify
4. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits

**Key Principle**: Secrets belong in environment variables or configuration files, never in code.
