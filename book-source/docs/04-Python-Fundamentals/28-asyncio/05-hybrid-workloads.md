# Lesson 5: Hybrid Workloads — Combining I/O and CPU for Peak Performance

## Opening Hook

Here's a realistic problem: **You're building an AI system that needs to fetch data from 1,000 API endpoints and process each response with heavy analysis.**

You have three choices:

1. **Sequential approach**: Fetch one, process it, then fetch the next. Total time = (1000 × fetch_time) + (1000 × process_time). On a typical system: 1000 × (0.1s fetch + 2s processing) = 2,100 seconds ≈ 35 minutes.

2. **Concurrent fetching only** (from Lesson 2): Fetch all 1,000 at once. But now you hit memory limits and API rate limits crash your system.

3. **Hybrid approach**: Fetch in batches of 10 while processing previous batches in parallel. Total time ≈ 300 seconds ≈ 5 minutes. That's **7x faster**, and you never run out of resources.

**This is the hybrid workload pattern.** It's what powers production AI systems that need both concurrent I/O (API calls) and parallel processing (inference, data transformation).

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand why hybrid workloads matter for AI applications, how to architect them efficiently, and how to optimize them for your specific hardware and network conditions.

---

## Understanding the Hybrid Pattern: I/O + CPU Together

### Why Separate I/O and CPU?

From Lesson 4, you learned that **asyncio helps with I/O-bound work** (waiting for network, disk, etc.) but **doesn't help with CPU-bound work** (the GIL prevents true parallelism). So what do you do when your workload has both?

**Answer**: You use both tools simultaneously.

- **asyncio.TaskGroup()** — Run multiple I/O operations concurrently (while one waits, another runs)
- **InterpreterPoolExecutor** — Run multiple CPU operations in true parallel (separate interpreters = separate GILs)

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "In a system that fetches data from APIs and processes it with heavy computation, explain how I/O and CPU work could overlap efficiently. What's the benefit of overlap versus sequential execution?"

#### The Core Pattern

Imagine stages in a pipeline:

```
Time:    0s         2s              4s              6s
Stage 1: [Fetch #1]  [Fetch #2]     [Fetch #3]
Stage 2:            [Process #1]    [Process #2]   [Process #3]
Stage 3:                           [Store #1]     [Store #2]
```

While you're **fetching** item #2, you're **processing** item #1 (CPU cores stay busy). While you're **processing** item #3, you're **storing** item #1 (I/O pipeline keeps flowing).

This is what **hybrid workloads** achieve: **parallel execution of fundamentally different types of work**.

#### 🎓 Instructor Commentary

> In AI-native development, you don't choose between concurrency and parallelism—you use both. This is why Python 3.14's InterpreterPoolExecutor paired with asyncio creates such powerful systems. The pattern is: "concurrent I/O boundaries" around "parallel CPU cores."

### Real-World Example: AI Workload Characteristics

Most AI applications look like this:

1. **Fetch** — Call an API, get data (I/O-bound, waiting on network)
2. **Process** — Run inference, transform data (CPU-bound, heavy computation)
3. **Store** — Write to database (I/O-bound, waiting on storage)

Each stage has different resource constraints:
- Fetching is limited by network bandwidth (often 100-1000 requests in flight is fine)
- Processing is limited by CPU cores (4-8 workers for a typical machine)
- Storing is limited by database connection pool (often 5-20 connections)

A naive approach would run all three sequentially. A better approach would batch them: fetch 10, process in parallel, store, repeat.

#### 🚀 CoLearning Challenge

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Describe how you would optimize a system that needs to fetch 10,000 items from an API, analyze each with CPU-intensive text processing, and store results in a database. What would your batch size be? How many workers for each stage? Why?"

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand how to think about bottlenecks, resource constraints, and throughput optimization.

## Code Example 1: Simple Hybrid Pattern (Fetch → Process)

Let's start with the simplest hybrid case: **fetch one item, process it in parallel, repeat.**

**Specification Reference**: Basic hybrid pattern
**Prompt Used**: "Create a system that fetches N items from a mock API concurrently and processes each with CPU-intensive work, with proper type hints and error handling"

```python
import asyncio
from concurrent.futures import Executor
from typing import Any
import time

async def fetch_item(item_id: int) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Simulate fetching an item from an API."""
    # Simulate network latency (100-200ms)
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1 + (item_id % 2) * 0.1)
    return {"id": item_id, "data": f"item-{item_id}-data"}

def process_item(item: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """CPU-intensive processing of fetched item."""
    # Simulate heavy computation (CPU-bound, ~500ms)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    result = {
        **item,
        "processed": True,
        "analysis": f"analyzed-{item['data']}",
    }
    return result

async def simple_hybrid(item_ids: list[int], executor: Executor) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Fetch items concurrently, then process each in parallel.

    Demonstrates basic hybrid: I/O concurrency (fetch) + CPU parallelism (process).
    Total time: ~1-2 seconds (overlapped)
    Sequential would take: ~7 seconds (5 items × 1.4s per item)
    """
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()

    # Step 1: Fetch all items concurrently (I/O phase)
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
        fetch_tasks = [
            tg.create_task(fetch_item(item_id))
            for item_id in item_ids
        ]

    fetched_items = [task.result() for task in fetch_tasks]
    print(f"✓ Fetched {len(fetched_items)} items in ~0.2s")

    # Step 2: Process all items in parallel (CPU phase)
    # Use run_in_executor to offload CPU work to separate interpreters
    process_tasks = [
        loop.run_in_executor(executor, process_item, item)
        for item in fetched_items
    ]

    processed_items = await asyncio.gather(*process_tasks)
    print(f"✓ Processed {len(processed_items)} items in ~0.5s (parallel)")

    return processed_items

# Validation steps
async def main() -> None:
    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
    # ⚠️ For CPU-bound work, use InterpreterPoolExecutor (not shown in this small example)
    # For demonstration, ThreadPoolExecutor shows structure (though it won't parallelize CPU)

    executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)

    start = time.time()
    results = await simple_hybrid([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], executor)
    elapsed = time.time() - start

    print(f"\n✓ Total hybrid time: {elapsed:.2f}s")
    print(f"✓ Sequential time would be: ~{5 * 1.4:.1f}s")
    print(f"✓ Speedup: {5 * 1.4 / elapsed:.1f}x")
    print(f"✓ Processed {len(results)} items")

    executor.shutdown(wait=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Validation Steps**:
1. Run the code and observe total time (~0.7s for fetch+process)
2. Notice how fetching completes quickly, then processing happens in parallel
3. With ThreadPoolExecutor shown here (for simplicity), CPU doesn't parallelize; with InterpreterPoolExecutor (Python 3.14), you'd see true parallelism

**Key Insight**: The `loop.run_in_executor()` bridges sync CPU work into async I/O flow. While one CPU task runs, the event loop can handle other I/O operations.

#### ✨ Teaching Tip

> Use your AI co-teacher to explore: "In the simple_hybrid function, why do we fetch all items first, then process all items second? What would happen if we fetched and processed in a mixed order?"

## Code Example 2: Batch Processing Pattern

Real-world systems rarely have enough memory to fetch all items at once. Instead, you fetch in **batches**.

**Specification Reference**: Batch processing with resource limits
**Prompt Used**: "Create a batch processing system that fetches N items in groups of B, processes in parallel, then repeats"

```python
import asyncio
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor  # Use InterpreterPoolExecutor in production
from typing import TypeVar, Callable, Any
import time

T = TypeVar("T")
U = TypeVar("U")

async def fetch_batch(
    batch_ids: list[int],
    delay_per_item: float = 0.05,
) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    """Fetch a batch of items concurrently."""
    async def fetch_one(item_id: int) -> dict[str, Any]:
        await asyncio.sleep(delay_per_item)  # Simulate network
        return {"id": item_id, "raw_data": f"data-{item_id}"}

    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
        tasks = [tg.create_task(fetch_one(item_id)) for item_id in batch_ids]

    return [task.result() for task in tasks]

def process_batch(
    items: list[dict[str, Any]],
    cpu_time_per_item: float = 0.1,
) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    """Process a batch of items (CPU-bound, runs in executor)."""
    time.sleep(cpu_time_per_item * len(items))  # Simulate heavy processing
    return [
        {**item, "processed": True, "result": f"result-{item['id']}"}
        for item in items
    ]

async def batch_processing_system(
    total_items: int,
    batch_size: int,
    executor: ThreadPoolExecutor,
) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Process items in batches: fetch batch → process batch → repeat.

    Reduces memory usage and allows resource control.
    """
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    results: list[dict[str, Any]] = []

    # Process in batches
    for batch_num in range(0, total_items, batch_size):
        batch_ids = list(range(batch_num, min(batch_num + batch_size, total_items)))

        # Fetch this batch concurrently
        print(f"  Batch {batch_num // batch_size + 1}: Fetching {len(batch_ids)} items...")
        fetched = await fetch_batch(batch_ids)

        # Process this batch in parallel
        print(f"  Batch {batch_num // batch_size + 1}: Processing {len(fetched)} items...")
        processed = await loop.run_in_executor(
            executor,
            process_batch,
            fetched,
        )

        results.extend(processed)

    return results

# Validation example
async def main() -> None:
    executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)

    print("Batch Processing System Demo")
    print("=" * 50)

    start = time.time()
    results = await batch_processing_system(
        total_items=20,
        batch_size=5,
        executor=executor,
    )
    elapsed = time.time() - start

    print(f"\n✓ Processed {len(results)} items in {elapsed:.2f}s")
    print(f"  Batch size: 5 items")
    print(f"  Number of batches: {(20 + 4) // 5}")

    executor.shutdown(wait=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Why Batching Matters**:
- **Memory**: Fetch 5 items, process, store. Not 1,000 in memory at once.
- **Throughput**: Process while fetching next batch (pipeline overlap)
- **Resource Control**: Never overwhelm the server or database

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

## Code Example 3: Pipeline Pattern (Fetch → Transform → Store)

The most powerful hybrid pattern has **three stages running in parallel**.

**Specification Reference**: Three-stage pipeline with overlapping execution
**Prompt Used**: "Implement a fetch-transform-store pipeline where stages overlap using asyncio queues"

```python
import asyncio
from asyncio import Queue
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from typing import Any
import time

async def pipeline_fetch_stage(
    queue: Queue[dict[str, Any] | None],
    total_items: int,
    items_per_batch: int = 10,
) -> None:
    """

    """
    for batch_start in range(0, total_items, items_per_batch):
        batch_ids = list(range(batch_start, min(batch_start + items_per_batch, total_items)))

        # Fetch batch concurrently (simulates network I/O)
        async def fetch_one(item_id: int) -> dict[str, Any]:

**Pipeline Benefits**:
- **Overlap**: While fetching item #20, transform item #10, store item #5
- **Throughput**: Queues decouple stages, each stage keeps busy
- **Resource Control**: Queues have max sizes, preventing runaway memory

#### 🎓 Instructor Commentary

> Pipeline patterns are everywhere in production systems: data ETL, stream processing, real-time inference. The pattern is simple: decouple stages with queues, run concurrently, and watch throughput improve. This is why asyncio + queues are so powerful for backend systems.

**Key Insight for AI Applications**:
- **Fetch phase** is I/O-bound (network waiting)
- **Inference phase** is CPU-bound (computation)
- **Hybrid pattern** overlaps them: fetch next batch while processing current batch
- This is exactly how production AI systems (like Claude's backend) work

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

## Code Example 5: Resource Limiting with Semaphores

Real-world systems have limits: you can't fetch infinitely from an API, can't run infinitely many inference tasks.

**Specification Reference**: Controlling concurrency with Semaphores
**Prompt Used**: "Create a system that limits concurrent I/O to N requests and CPU workers to M processes using Semaphores"

```python
import asyncio

        max_concurrent_processes=3,  # Machine has 3 free cores
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Why Semaphores Matter**:
- **API Rate Limiting**: Don't send 1000 requests at once; send 5-10 at a time
- **CPU Worker Limits**: Don't spawn 100 workers on a 4-core machine; spawn 4
- **Database Connections**: Don't open 1000 connections; use connection pool (5-20)

#### ✨ Teaching Tip

> Use your AI co-teacher to explore: "If you have 1000 items to process and a 4-core machine, is max_concurrent_processes = 4 always optimal? When might you want 8 or 2 instead?"

**Production-Ready Features**:
- **Error handling**: Try/except at each stage, graceful failures
- **Timeouts**: Each operation has timeout to prevent hanging
- **Fallback strategies**: If database fails, log to file instead
- **Partial success**: If 1-2 items fail, system continues
- **Monitoring**: Log progress, measure timing, calculate metrics
- **Batching**: Process in chunks for memory efficiency

## Identifying and Optimizing Bottlenecks

Real hybrid systems don't work optimally by accident. You need to **measure** where the bottleneck is.

### Common Bottleneck Scenarios

**Scenario 1: I/O-Bound Bottleneck**
```
Time: 0s         5s              10s             15s
Fetch: [-------fetch-10s-------]
Proc:             [--process--]   [--process--]
Time to completion: 15s (waiting for fetches)
```
**Solution**: Increase fetch concurrency (higher `TaskGroup` density)

**Scenario 2: CPU-Bound Bottleneck**
```
Time: 0s    2s      4s      6s      8s      10s
Fetch:  [fetch]
Proc:         [----process--]  [----process--]  [----process--]
Time to completion: 10s (waiting for CPU processing)
```
**Solution**: Increase CPU workers (more InterpreterPoolExecutor workers)

**Scenario 3: Storage Bottleneck**
```
Time: 0s    2s    4s    6s    8s    10s   12s
Fetch: [fetch]
Proc:      [proc]
Store:         [store----]  [store----]  [store----]
Time to completion: 12s (waiting for database)
```
**Solution**: Increase database connections, or batch stores

### How to Identify Your Bottleneck

```python
# Measure each stage independently
fetch_times: list[float] = []
process_times: list[float] = []
store_times: list[float] = []

for item in results:
    fetch_times.append(item.fetch_time)
    process_times.append(item.process_time)
    store_times.append(item.store_time)

avg_fetch = sum(fetch_times) / len(fetch_times)
avg_process = sum(process_times) / len(process_times)
avg_store = sum(store_times) / len(store_times)

# Bottleneck is the longest average stage
bottleneck = max(
    ("fetch", avg_fetch),
    ("process", avg_process),
    ("store", avg_store),
)

print(f"Bottleneck: {bottleneck[0]} taking {bottleneck[1]:.3f}s per item")
```

#### 🚀 CoLearning Challenge

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "You have a system where fetch takes 0.1s per item, process takes 0.5s per item, and store takes 0.05s per item. You have 1000 items to process and a 4-core machine. What's the optimal batch size and worker allocation?"

**Expected Outcome**: You'll think about bottlenecks systematically—identifying which stage limits throughput, then optimizing resource allocation accordingly.

---

## Try With AI

You've now learned how to build hybrid systems that leverage both I/O concurrency and CPU parallelism. Use your AI co-teacher to deepen your understanding and explore real-world applications.

### Prompt 1: Understanding (Explain Concepts)

**Tell your AI co-teacher:**
> "I'm building a system that fetches 10,000 items from an API and processes each with machine learning inference. Explain how I/O concurrency and CPU parallelism would overlap in this system. What would the execution timeline look like?"

**Expected Outcome**: AI explains pipelining—while you're fetching batch 2, you're processing batch 1, and storing batch 0. Understanding this overlap is the key to hybrid performance.

### Prompt 2: Application (Generate and Validate Code)

**Tell your AI co-teacher:**
> "Generate a hybrid system that fetches from 3 different APIs concurrently and processes each with a CPU-intensive task (use time.sleep for simulation). Use asyncio.TaskGroup for fetching and a ThreadPoolExecutor for processing. Include type hints and proper error handling."

**Expected Outcome**: AI generates complete code. You validate by running it and verifying:
- All 3 fetches happen concurrently (measure time)
- Processing happens in parallel (monitor CPU usage)
- Total time is less than sequential (typical speedup: 2-3x)

### Prompt 3: Analysis (Identify Bottlenecks)

**Ask your AI co-teacher:**
> "Given this hybrid system: fetch takes 1s per item, process takes 2s per item, store takes 0.5s per item. I have 100 items and a 4-core machine. What's the bottleneck? How would you optimize it? What batch size would you choose?"

**Expected Outcome**: AI identifies CPU as bottleneck (process is slowest), recommends batch size based on resource constraints, suggests worker allocation. You learn systematic bottleneck analysis.

### Prompt 4: Design (Architect a Real System)

**Design challenge:**
> "You're building an AI data pipeline: fetch documents from cloud storage (10s per batch), extract text (CPU-intensive, 5s per document), generate embeddings (CPU-intensive, 2s per document), and store in vector database (0.1s per document). You have a 8-core machine and budget for 10 concurrent cloud operations. Design the optimal architecture: batch sizes, worker counts, and stage orchestration. Ask your AI what trade-offs exist."

**Expected Outcome**: You design a production-grade system, articulate resource constraints, explain optimization choices to AI, receive feedback on architecture. This is what production AI engineering looks like.

---

**Safety & Ethics Note**: When using AI to generate parallel/concurrent systems, always verify:
- No race conditions (shared state protected by locks)
- Proper timeout handling (system can't hang indefinitely)
- Resource cleanup (executor shutdown, queue drains)
- Error resilience (partial failures don't crash the whole system)

Ask your AI co-teacher: "Are there any race conditions or resource leaks in this code?" when validating generated systems.
