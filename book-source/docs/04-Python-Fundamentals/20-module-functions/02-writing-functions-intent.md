## Lesson 2: Writing Functions with Intent

**CEFR Level**: A2-B1 (Foundational with Application)
**Time Estimate**: 60 minutes
**What You'll Learn**: Functions are reusable blocks of code. You'll learn to write functions with clear intent—using type hints to tell Python (and AI) what data you need, and docstrings to explain what your function does.

---

## Why Write Functions? — Code Reuse and Clear Intent

**The Problem**: You find yourself writing the same code over and over. A calculation you need in three different places. A data validation check used throughout your script.

**The Solution**: Write a function once, call it many times. Better yet, write it with such clear intent (type hints + docstring) that other developers (or AI) understand exactly what it does without reading the implementation.

### 💻 Code Idea: Function as Organized Intent

```python
# Instead of this (repeated calculation):
result1: int = 5 + 3
result2: int = 10 + 7
result3: int = 2 + 8

# Do this (function, reused):
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Return the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b

result1: int = add(5, 3)
result2: int = add(10, 7)
result3: int = add(2, 8)
```

**Why this matters**: The function signature (`def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:`) tells you everything you need to know: it takes two integers and returns an integer. That's the intent. The docstring explains the purpose. The body is just the implementation.

### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> Ask your AI: "I need a function that takes a list of prices and calculates total cost with 10% tax. What should the type hints be? What should the docstring say? Write just the function signature (def line through docstring, no body yet)."

**Expected Understanding**: You see that **intent comes before implementation**. A clear function signature (especially with type hints) lets you think about WHAT you need before HOW to code it.

### 🎓 Instructor Commentary

Type hints are not just syntax—they're your contract with other developers and AI. When you write `def calculate(items: list[float]) -> float:`, you're making a promise: "I accept a list of floats and return a single float." This is incredibly powerful. AI can validate your code against this contract. Other developers know exactly what to pass and what to expect back. Syntax is cheap and forgettable. Semantics—the meaning behind the code—is what matters. Type hints encode semantics directly into your function signature.

---

## Function Definition — The Structure

**Components of a Function**:

```python
def function_name(parameter1: Type1, parameter2: Type2) -> ReturnType:
    """Docstring: explain what the function does."""
    # Function body: code that does the work
    result = parameter1 + parameter2
    return result
```

- **`def`** — Python keyword that starts a function definition
- **`function_name`** — What you call the function (use descriptive names)
- **`parameters`** — Variables the function receives when called
- **`Type hints`** — Tell what type each parameter should be, and what type is returned
- **`Docstring`** — Multi-line string explaining the function's purpose
- **`return`** — Send a value back to the caller

### 💻 Code Idea: Simple Function with Type Hints

```python
# Function definition
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two integers and return the sum."""
    return a + b

# Calling the function
result: int = add(5, 3)
print(f"5 + 3 = {result}")  # Output: 8

# Another example
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Return a greeting message for the given name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

greeting: str = greet("Alice")
print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

**Key Observation**: The type hints (`int`, `str`, `->`) are hints for humans and type checkers. Python executes the function the same way without them, but they make intent clear.

---

## Type Hints as Intent Specification

**What Type Hints Say**: Type hints are your specification. They answer: "What data types should this function receive? What type will it return?"

### 💻 Code Idea: Type Hints on Complex Parameters

```python
def calculate_average(numbers: list[float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.

    Parameters:
        numbers (list[float]): List of numeric values

    Returns:
        float: The average (mean) of all numbers
    """
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        return 0.0

    total: float = sum(numbers)
    average: float = total / len(numbers)
    return average

# Call the function with a list of floats
scores: list[float] = [85.5, 90.0, 78.5, 92.0]
avg: float = calculate_average(scores)
print(f"Average score: {avg:.2f}")  # 86.5
```

**Reading the Type Hint**: `numbers: list[float]` says "numbers must be a list of floats." Return type `-> float` says "this function returns a single float."

---

## Docstrings — Communication for Humans and AI

**Purpose**: A docstring explains what the function does. It's not a comment about implementation details—it's documentation for the USER of the function.

### 💻 Code Idea: Well-Documented Function

```python
def divide_with_remainder(dividend: int, divisor: int) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """
    Divide two integers and return quotient and remainder.

    Parameters:
        dividend (int): Number to divide
        divisor (int): Number to divide by

    Returns:
        tuple[int, int]: (quotient, remainder)
    """
    quotient: int = dividend // divisor
    remainder: int = dividend % divisor
    return quotient, remainder

# Use the function
q, r = divide_with_remainder(17, 5)
print(f"17 ÷ 5 = {q} remainder {r}")  # 3 remainder 2
```

**Docstring Structure**:
1. **One-line summary** — What does this function do?
2. **Parameters section** — What inputs does it take?
3. **Returns section** — What does it return?

---

## Functions with Multiple Parameters and Default Values

### 💻 Code Idea: Function with Optional Parameter

```python
def format_name(first: str, last: str, uppercase: bool = False) -> str:
    """
    Format a person's name.

    Parameters:
        first (str): First name
        last (str): Last name
        uppercase (bool): Whether to convert to uppercase (default: False)

    Returns:
        str: Formatted full name
    """
    full_name: str = f"{first} {last}"
    return full_name.upper() if uppercase else full_name

# Call with default parameter
print(format_name("alice", "smith"))          # alice smith

# Call with optional parameter specified
print(format_name("alice", "smith", True))    # ALICE SMITH
```

**Key Point**: The parameter `uppercase: bool = False` means it's optional. If you don't provide it, Python uses `False` by default.

---

## Functions Returning Multiple Values

**Pattern**: When a function needs to return multiple pieces of information, return a tuple and unpack it.

### 💻 Code Idea: Return and Unpack Multiple Values

```python
def get_user_info(username: str) -> tuple[str, str, int]:
    """
    Get user information.

    Returns:
        tuple[str, str, int]: (name, email, age)
    """
    # In a real scenario, this would query a database
    if username == "alice":
        return "Alice Smith", "alice@example.com", 30
    else:
        return "Unknown", "unknown@example.com", 0

# Unpack the returned tuple
name, email, age = get_user_info("alice")
print(f"Name: {name}, Email: {email}, Age: {age}")
# Output: Name: Alice Smith, Email: alice@example.com, Age: 30
```

**Why this pattern?** Type hints make it clear you're returning three values. The unpacking line shows exactly what each return value represents.

---

## Functions Checking Conditions — Predicates

**Pattern**: Functions that return `True` or `False` are called predicates. They answer yes/no questions.

### 💻 Code Idea: Predicate Functions

```python
def is_even(number: int) -> bool:
    """Check if a number is even."""
    return number % 2 == 0

def is_within_range(value: int, min_val: int, max_val: int) -> bool:
    """Check if a value is within a specified range."""
    return min_val <= value <= max_val

# Use predicates in conditions
print(is_even(4))                    # True
print(is_even(7))                    # False
print(is_within_range(50, 0, 100))   # True
print(is_within_range(150, 0, 100))  # False
```

**Key Point**: Boolean return types (`-> bool`) make it clear the function answers a yes/no question.

---

## Functions Processing Collections

### 💻 Code Idea: Function Working with Lists

```python
def filter_scores(scores: list[float], minimum: float = 0.0) -> list[float]:
    """
    Filter scores, keeping only those above minimum.

    Parameters:
        scores (list[float]): List of score values
        minimum (float): Minimum acceptable score (default: 0.0)

    Returns:
        list[float]: Filtered list of scores
    """
    result: list[float] = []
    for score in scores:
        if score >= minimum:
            result.append(score)
    return result

# Use the function
all_scores: list[float] = [65.0, 85.5, 72.0, 95.0, 58.5]
passing: list[float] = filter_scores(all_scores, 70.0)
print(f"Passing scores: {passing}")  # [85.5, 72.0, 95.0]
```

**Reading the Type Hint**: `scores: list[float]` → input list of floats, `-> list[float]` → output list of floats.

---

## Calling Functions — Using Return Values

### 💻 Code Idea: Function Return Values Flow Through Code

```python
def double(x: int) -> int:
    """Return the value doubled."""
    return x * 2

def add_ten(x: int) -> int:
    """Add ten to the value."""
    return x + 10

# Chain function calls: the output of one becomes input to next
starting_value: int = 5
doubled: int = double(starting_value)      # 10
final: int = add_ten(doubled)              # 20

print(f"Start: {starting_value} → Double: {doubled} → Add 10: {final}")
# Output: Start: 5 → Double: 10 → Add 10: 20
```

**Key Insight**: Function return values are just data. You can pass them to another function, store them, or print them.

## 🚀 Specification Challenge

Choose a real calculation you do regularly (convert temperature, calculate tip, check if someone qualifies for a discount). Write the function **signature only** (just `def` line through docstring, no body):

1. What parameters do you need?
2. What type should each parameter be?
3. What type will you return?
4. What will your docstring say?

Then tell your AI: *"Here's my function signature. Generate the implementation."* Compare what you expected vs. what AI generated. This teaches you how clarity of intent affects code generation.

---

## ✨ AI Tool Tip

Your AI can generate function bodies from docstrings. The process:

1. **You write the specification** (function signature + docstring)
2. **Your AI implements it** ("Implement this function")
3. **You validate it works** (Test with examples)

Better specifications → better AI output. This is how AI-native developers work.

---

## Try With AI

Use your AI companion (Claude Code or Gemini CLI). You'll explore function definitions, type hints, and docstrings by writing and testing functions.

### Prompt 1: Recognize Function Components (Remember Level)

```
Look at this function and identify each part:

def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Return the product of two integers."""
    return a * b

Point out:
1. The function name
2. The parameters and their types
3. The return type
4. The docstring

What does each part tell you about what this function does?
```

**Expected outcome**: You identify all components and understand that type hints communicate intent clearly.

---

### Prompt 2: Write a Simple Function (Understand/Apply Level)

```
Write a function called `double` that:
1. Takes an integer as input
2. Returns that integer multiplied by 2
3. Includes type hints and a docstring

Test your function with 3 different inputs (positive, negative, zero).
What do you observe about the behavior?
```

**Expected outcome**: You write a valid function with type hints, docstring, and test it successfully.

---

### Prompt 3: Write Function with Multiple Returns (Apply Level)

```
Write a function called `summarize_scores` that:
1. Takes a list of test scores (floats) as input
2. Returns three values as a tuple: (highest_score, lowest_score, average_score)
3. Includes appropriate type hints and docstring

Call your function with a list: [85.0, 92.0, 78.0, 88.0, 95.0]
Unpack the three return values into separate variables.
Print each one with a label.
```

**Expected outcome**: You write function returning `tuple[float, float, float]`, call it correctly, and unpack the result.

---

### Prompt 4: Connect Intent to Implementation (Analyze/Synthesize Level)

```
Think of a real task you do (convert a temperature, check if a password is valid,
calculate a discount).

Write the function signature WITH a clear docstring that describes:
- What the function does
- What inputs it needs (and their types)
- What it returns (and the type)

Ask your AI: "Generate the implementation for this function."

Compare what you expected vs. what AI generated. Did the docstring guide the AI well?
What was unclear? This teaches you how clear specifications improve AI code generation.
```

**Expected outcome**: You experience how function signatures + docstrings guide AI code generation. You learn that clarity of intent is more valuable than perfect syntax.
