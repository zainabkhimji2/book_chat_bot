# Chapter 14: Data Types

**Learning with AI as Your Partner**

In Chapter 13, you learned what Python is and ran your first Hello World program using `print()`. Now it's time to learn how to **store data in variables** and understand **what types are and why they matter**.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will:

- Create variables with type hints to store different kinds of data
- Understand what a data type is and why Python uses them
- Work with core types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, and `None`
- Explore collections (list, tuple, dict, set) at awareness level
- Build an interactive type explorer demonstrating all concepts
