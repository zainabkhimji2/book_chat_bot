# Frozensets: Immutable Sets for Hashable Contexts

In Lesson 3, you discovered that sets are blazingly fast because they use **hashing** — storing elements based on computed integer values. But there was a catch: elements must be **immutable** because their hash values must never change.

This lesson introduces **frozensets** — the immutable sibling of the mutable `set`. A frozenset is a set that can't be modified after creation. This simple constraint unlocks powerful capabilities: **frozensets can be dictionary keys. Frozensets can be members of other sets. Frozensets can be used anywhere immutability is required.**

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand when frozensets are necessary and how they enable designs that regular sets can't achieve.

💬 **Why This Matters**: Real-world applications often need to store collections as keys or group collections together. Regular sets can't do this. Frozensets solve this elegantly. Understanding the trade-off between mutability and hashability is a mark of intermediate Python competence.

---

## Concept: Frozenset as Immutable Set

A **frozenset** is created using the `frozenset()` constructor. Unlike sets, frozensets cannot be modified after creation — no `.add()`, `.remove()`, or `.discard()` methods exist.

The trade-off is deliberate:

- **Set (mutable)**: Can add/remove elements anytime; cannot be dict keys; cannot be in sets
- **Frozenset (immutable)**: Cannot change after creation; CAN be dict keys; CAN be in sets

Here's how to create frozensets:

```python
# Create from a list
coordinates: frozenset[int] = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
print(coordinates)  # frozenset({1, 2, 3})

# Create from another set
my_set: set[str] = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
frozen: frozenset[str] = frozenset(my_set)
print(frozen)  # frozenset({'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'})

# Create empty frozenset
empty: frozenset[int] = frozenset()
print(empty)  # frozenset()

# Verify it's hashable
print(f"Frozenset is hashable: {hash(coordinates)}")  # <some integer>
```

**Key Observation**: Notice the type hints: `frozenset[int]`, `frozenset[str]`. These follow the same pattern as sets, making the distinction clear to anyone reading your code.

Attempting to modify a frozenset raises an error:

```python
my_frozen: frozenset[int] = frozenset([1, 2, 3])

try:
    my_frozen.add(4)  # ❌ Method doesn't exist
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'

try:
    my_frozen.remove(1)  # ❌ Method doesn't exist
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'remove'
```

💬 **Thinking Point**: Notice the error is `AttributeError`, not `TypeError`. The methods literally don't exist on frozenset objects. This is Python's way of enforcing immutability at the language level.

---

## Concept: Frozensets Are Hashable (The Superpower)

Because frozensets are immutable, they are **hashable**. This means you can use them in two powerful contexts:

1. **As dictionary keys**
2. **As members of sets**

Regular sets cannot do either of these. Let's see why:

### Frozensets as Dictionary Keys

Regular sets cannot be dictionary keys because they're mutable and unhashable:

```python
# ❌ This fails
try:
    bad_dict: dict[set[int], str] = {
        {1, 2}: "pair",
        {3, 4}: "another"
    }
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # unhashable type: 'set'
```

But frozensets work perfectly as keys:

```python
# ✅ This works
user_groups: dict[frozenset[str], str] = {
    frozenset({"admin", "user"}): "Full access",
    frozenset({"user"}): "Read-only access",
    frozenset({"guest"}): "Public access"
}

# Lookup by frozenset key
admin_access: str = user_groups[frozenset({"admin", "user"})]
print(f"Admin group access: {admin_access}")  # Full access
```

**Real-World Use Case: Permission System**

Imagine a permission system where user roles determine access level:

```python
# Define permission tiers as frozenset keys
permission_levels: dict[frozenset[str], str] = {
    frozenset({"admin"}): "Can do everything",
    frozenset({"admin", "moderator"}): "Can moderate and administer",
    frozenset({"moderator"}): "Can moderate content",
    frozenset({"user"}): "Can read and comment",
    frozenset({"guest"}): "Can read only"
}

# Check user permissions
def get_access_level(user_roles: frozenset[str]) -> str:
    return permission_levels.get(user_roles, "Undefined access level")

alice_roles: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"admin", "moderator"})
print(get_access_level(alice_roles))  # Can moderate and administer
```

This pattern is elegant: the user's role set IS the key. No separate lookups needed.

---

## Concept: Nesting Frozensets in Sets

Regular sets cannot contain sets (because sets aren't hashable). But they can contain frozensets:

```python
# ❌ This fails
try:
    nested_sets: set[set[int]] = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # unhashable type: 'set'

# ✅ This works
teams: set[frozenset[str]] = {
    frozenset({"Alice", "Bob"}),
    frozenset({"Bob", "Charlie"}),
    frozenset({"Alice", "Charlie"})
}

print(f"All teams: {teams}")
# All teams: {frozenset({'Alice', 'Bob'}), frozenset({'Bob', 'Charlie'}), frozenset({'Alice', 'Charlie'})}
```

**Real-World Use Case: Finding All Team Members**

```python
# Find all unique members across all teams
teams: set[frozenset[str]] = {
    frozenset({"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"}),
    frozenset({"David", "Eve"}),
    frozenset({"Frank", "Alice"})
}

all_members: set[str] = set()
for team in teams:
    all_members |= team  # Union with each team's members

print(f"All team members: {all_members}")  # {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve', 'Frank'}
```

🎓 **Learning Insight**: Notice how we converted frozensets back to a regular set when needing mutability. Python allows this conversion freely — there's no performance penalty.

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Creating and Verifying Frozensets

**Specification**: Create frozensets from various sources, verify immutability and hashability.

**AI Prompt Used**: "Show me how to create frozensets in Python 3.14+ with type hints, and verify that they're immutable and hashable."

```python
# Create frozensets with type hints
colors: frozenset[str] = frozenset(["red", "green", "blue"])
numbers: frozenset[int] = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
empty: frozenset[str] = frozenset()

# Verify type
print(f"Type of colors: {type(colors)}")  # <class 'frozenset'>

# Verify hashability (can get hash value)
color_hash: int = hash(colors)
print(f"Hash of frozenset: {color_hash}")  # Some integer

# Verify immutability - no modification methods
print(f"Methods available: {[m for m in dir(colors) if not m.startswith('_')]}")
# Shows: copy, difference, intersection, isdisjoint, issubset, issuperset, symmetric_difference, union

# Verify read-only operations work
union_result: frozenset[str] = colors | frozenset(["yellow"])
print(f"Union works: {union_result}")  # frozenset({'red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow'})

# Verify assignment/modification fails
try:
    colors.add("yellow")
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Cannot modify frozenset: {e}")  # 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Type of colors: <class 'frozenset'>
Hash of frozenset: -5483841318619854644
Methods available: ['copy', 'difference', 'intersection', 'isdisjoint', 'issubset', 'issuperset', 'symmetric_difference', 'union']
Union works: frozenset({'red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow'})
Cannot modify frozenset: 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'
```

### Example 2: Using Frozensets as Dictionary Keys

**Specification**: Show that regular sets fail as dict keys, but frozensets work. Demonstrate practical use case.

**AI Prompt Used**: "Create a Python example showing why I can't use sets as dictionary keys but CAN use frozensets, with a realistic business scenario."

```python
# First, show the problem with regular sets
print("Attempting to use set as dictionary key:")
try:
    bad_dict: dict[set[str], int] = {
        {1, 2, 3}: 100  # ❌ Try to use set as key
    }
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"  ❌ Error: {e}")  # unhashable type: 'set'

# Now show the solution with frozensets
print("\nUsing frozenset as dictionary key:")

# Scenario: Coordinate lookup for locations
location_coordinates: dict[frozenset[tuple[int, int]], str] = {
    frozenset([(0, 0), (1, 1)]): "diagonal_main",
    frozenset([(2, 0), (0, 2)]): "corners",
    frozenset([(5, 5)]): "center_point"
}

# Look up location by coordinate set
query: frozenset[tuple[int, int]] = frozenset([(0, 0), (1, 1)])
location: str = location_coordinates.get(query, "Unknown location")
print(f"  Location found: {location}")  # diagonal_main

# More practical: Permission levels as frozenset keys
permission_tiers: dict[frozenset[str], list[str]] = {
    frozenset(["admin"]): ["read", "write", "delete", "manage_users"],
    frozenset(["moderator"]): ["read", "write", "delete"],
    frozenset(["user"]): ["read", "write"],
    frozenset(["guest"]): ["read"]
}

# Check what a user with specific roles can do
user_bob_roles: frozenset[str] = frozenset(["user"])
bob_permissions: list[str] = permission_tiers.get(user_bob_roles, [])
print(f"  Bob's permissions: {bob_permissions}")  # ['read', 'write']
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Attempting to use set as dictionary key:
  ❌ Error: unhashable type: 'set'

Using frozenset as dictionary key:
  Location found: diagonal_main
  Bob's permissions: ['read', 'write']
```

---

### Example 3: Nesting Frozensets in Sets

**Specification**: Show that regular sets cannot be nested, but frozensets can. Demonstrate operations on nested structures.

**AI Prompt Used**: "Show me how to create a set of frozensets and perform operations on nested frozenset structures."

```python
# Show the problem with nested sets
print("Attempting to nest sets:")
try:
    nested_sets: set[set[int]] = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"  ❌ Error: {e}")  # unhashable type: 'set'

# Solution: Use frozensets
print("\nNesting frozensets in sets:")

# Represent student groups in different clubs
clubs: set[frozenset[str]] = {
    frozenset({"Alice", "Bob"}),        # chess club
    frozenset({"Bob", "Charlie"}),      # debate club
    frozenset({"Alice", "Charlie"}),    # math club
    frozenset({"David"})                # solo club
}

print(f"Total unique groups: {len(clubs)}")  # 4

# Find all students involved in clubs
all_members: set[str] = set()
for club_members in clubs:
    all_members |= club_members

print(f"All club members: {all_members}")  # {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'}

# Find the most popular students (in multiple clubs)
member_count: dict[str, int] = {}
for club_members in clubs:
    for member in club_members:
        member_count[member] = member_count.get(member, 0) + 1

popular: [str] = [name for name, count in member_count.items() if count > 1]
print(f"Members in multiple clubs: {popular}")  # ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']

# Find which students are in the same clubs
alice_clubs: set[frozenset[str]] = {club for club in clubs if "Alice" in club}
bob_clubs: set[frozenset[str]] = {club for club in clubs if "Bob" in club}

# Do they share any clubs?
shared: set[frozenset[str]] = alice_clubs & bob_clubs
print(f"Alice and Bob are in {len(shared)} club(s) together")  # 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Attempting to nest sets:
  ❌ Error: unhashable type: 'set'

Nesting frozensets in sets:
Total unique groups: 4
All club members: {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'}
Members in multiple clubs: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
Alice and Bob are in 1 club(s) together
```

---

### Example 4: Set vs. Frozenset Comparison

**Specification**: Create a decision matrix showing when to use set vs. frozenset.

**AI Prompt Used**: "Create a comparison showing the differences between set and frozenset, and when to use each one."

```python
from typing import Any

print("=" * 60)
print("SET vs. FROZENSET COMPARISON")
print("=" * 60)

## Practice Exercises

**Exercise 1: Create a Frozenset and Verify Hashability**

Create a frozenset containing 5 integers, then:
- Print it with proper type hint syntax
- Verify it's hashable by computing its hash value
- Try to add an element (expect an error)

**Exercise 2: Dictionary Keys with Frozensets**

Create a dictionary where the keys are frozensets representing permission levels. Each value should be a list of allowed actions. Implement a lookup function that takes a frozenset of roles and returns the corresponding actions.

**Exercise 3: Nesting Frozensets in Sets**

Create a set of frozensets representing groups of students. Then:
- Find the total number of unique students
- Find which students appear in multiple groups
- Find if two specific students share any groups

**Exercise 4: Convert Between Set and Frozenset**

Create a mutable set, convert it to a frozenset, then convert it back to a set. Verify that the conversion preserves elements and doesn't have a performance penalty.

## Try With AI

Use this section to solidify your understanding of frozensets through hands-on exploration with your AI companion.

💬 **Prompt 1: Understanding Immutability Trade-offs** (Understand Level)

Ask your AI: "What's the difference between a set and a frozenset? Why would I ever use frozenset instead of set? What am I trading to get immutability?"

**Expected Outcome**: Your AI explains the immutability constraint and highlights specific scenarios where frozensets become necessary (dict keys, set members, function arguments requiring hashable types).

**AI Tool to Use**: ChatGPT web (conceptual explanation with reasoning)

**Follow-up Question**: "Are there any performance differences between set and frozenset?"

---

💬 **Prompt 2: Dictionary Keys Use Case** (Apply Level)

Ask your AI: "Show me a practical example where frozensets as dictionary keys is the ONLY solution. Why can't I use a regular set? Why can't I use a different data structure?"

**Expected Outcome**: Your AI provides a realistic business scenario (permission system, caching, grouping) that demonstrates why frozensets are the right choice and why sets wouldn't work.

**AI Tool to Use**: Claude Code (generate example code + explain design reasoning)

**Follow-up Question**: "What if I try to use a tuple instead of a frozenset?"

---

💬 **Prompt 3: Nesting Practice** (Apply Level)

Ask your AI: "Write code that creates a set of frozensets representing teams in a company. Then implement a function that finds which employees are in multiple teams together."

**Expected Outcome**: Your AI analyzes the scenario, weighs trade-offs (list: can have duplicates, set: no duplicates but mutable, frozenset: no duplicates and immutable), and recommends the best choice with reasoning.

**AI Tool to Use**: Claude Code or ChatGPT (design discussion with code examples)

**Follow-up Question**: "What if I later need to add a new role to a user?"

---

🎓 **Reflection**: After exploring with your AI, write a 2-3 sentence explanation of when you'd use frozenset instead of set. What capability unlocks? What trade-off are you making?
