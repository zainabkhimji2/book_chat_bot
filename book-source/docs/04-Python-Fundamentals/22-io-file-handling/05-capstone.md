# Lesson 5: Capstone - Note-Taking App

## Introduction: Building a Real-World CLI Application

Welcome to the capstone project for Chapter 22! Everything you've learned in Lessons 1-4 comes together here. You're going to build a complete, production-quality CLI note-taking application that integrates:

- **Lesson 1**: Console I/O with input validation (menu-driven interface)
- **Lesson 2**: Safe file operations (reading and writing notes)
- **Lesson 3**: Cross-platform paths (organizing notes in directories)
- **Lesson 4**: JSON data format (persisting structured note data)

This isn't a toy project—it's a real application that demonstrates professional-level coding practices. When you're done, you'll have a program that:

- Runs without crashing, even with invalid user input
- Persists data to disk in organized directories
- Handles a dozen notes (or dozens) with responsive performance
- Recovers gracefully from common errors (missing files, corrupted data)
- Organizes code clearly so others can read and extend it

**Time Estimate**: 90-120 minutes of focused development (plus extension ideas if you want to go deeper)

**What You'll Build**: A fully functional Note-Taking App with these features:
1. **Menu-driven interface** - Display options, accept user choice, execute action, return to menu
2. **Create notes** - Prompt for title and body, save with UUID and timestamp
3. **Read notes** - List existing notes, display selected note
4. **Update notes** - Modify title, body, or category
5. **Delete notes** - Remove notes with confirmation
6. **Search notes** - Find notes by keyword across title and body
7. **List notes** - Show all notes organized by category
8. **Exit gracefully** - Clean shutdown with goodbye message

## Application Architecture Introduction

Before writing code, let's understand the design. A well-architected application separates concerns:

### Components

**Menu Loop** (Lessons 1)
- Displays menu options
- Accepts user choice
- Routes to appropriate function
- Returns to menu after operation

**CRUD Functions** (Lessons 2-4)
- `get_all_notes()` → Load all notes from disk
- `save_note()` → Write or update a note to disk
- `search_notes()` → Find notes by keyword
- `delete_note()` → Remove note file

**Data Structure** (Lesson 4)
```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "title": "Python Study Notes",
  "body": "Today learned about file I/O...",
  "category": "learning",
  "created": "2025-11-09T10:30:00",
  "modified": "2025-11-09T14:45:00"
}
```

**File Organization** (Lesson 3)
```
notes/
├── learning/
│   ├── 550e8400....json
│   └── 6f47fe8e....json
├── work/
│   └── a1b2c3d4....json
└── personal/
    └── x9y8z7w6....json
```

### Why This Design?

- **Separation of Concerns**: Menu loop doesn't know about file operations; functions don't know about UI
- **Scalability**: File-per-note approach handles 10-50 notes without performance issues
- **Maintainability**: Clear functions mean future extensions are easy
- **Testability**: Each function can be tested independently

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "I'm designing a note-taking app. Should I store all notes in one JSON file or one file per note? What are the tradeoffs?"

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand data persistence patterns and trade-offs before writing code. AI can help you think through design before implementation.

## Setting Up Project Structure

Every good application starts with organization. Let's initialize the directory structure and default categories.

### Creating the Notes Directory

First, we ensure the `notes/` directory exists with default categories for organization:

```python
from pathlib import Path

# Setup
BASE_DIR: Path = Path("notes")
BASE_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

# Create default categories
CATEGORIES: list[str] = ["work", "personal", "learning"]
for category in CATEGORIES:
    (BASE_DIR / category).mkdir(exist_ok=True)

print("✅ Note-taking app initialized!")
print(f"Data directory: {BASE_DIR.resolve()}")
```

**Why this matters**:
- Uses **pathlib** (Lesson 3) to create cross-platform paths
- Creates directories only if they don't exist (idempotent)
- Resolves absolute path to show user exactly where data is stored

#### 🎓 Instructor Commentary

> In AI-native development, you don't debug path errors manually—you design paths clearly at startup. Your job: specify the directory structure. AI can help you verify it's correct with `Path.resolve()`.

---

## Code Example 5.1: Project Structure and Security

Before we write the full app, let's look at how to initialize the project safely with security validation:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import uuid
import json
from datetime import datetime

# Setup
BASE_DIR: Path = Path("notes")
BASE_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

# Create default categories
CATEGORIES: list[str] = ["work", "personal", "learning"]
for category in CATEGORIES:
    (BASE_DIR / category).mkdir(exist_ok=True)

def get_note_path(category: str, note_id: str) -> Path:
    """
    Get safe path for a note with security validation.

    Uses resolve() to get canonical path, then validates it stays
    within the allowed BASE_DIR (prevents path traversal attacks).
    """
    # Resolve the requested path to canonical form
    requested_path: Path = (BASE_DIR / category / f"{note_id}.json").resolve()

    # Check that resolved path stays within base directory
    # is_relative_to() ensures path is under base_dir
    if not requested_path.is_relative_to(BASE_DIR.resolve()):
        raise ValueError(f"Security error: Invalid path {requested_path}")

    return requested_path

# Example: Create a new note
note_id: str = str(uuid.uuid4())
note: dict = {
    "id": note_id,
    "title": "My First Note",
    "body": "This is the body of my note.",
    "category": "learning",
    "created": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "modified": datetime.now().isoformat(),
}

# Save to file
note_path: Path = get_note_path("learning", note_id)
with open(note_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    json.dump(note, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)

print(f"✅ Note saved to: {note_path}")
```

**Specification Reference**: Path traversal prevention using `Path.resolve()` + `is_relative_to()` from Chapter 22, Lesson 3

**Prompt Used**: "Show me how to safely construct file paths that prevent directory traversal attacks using pathlib"

**Validation Steps**:
1. ✅ Test with normal path: `get_note_path("learning", uuid_string)` → returns valid path in notes/learning/
2. ✅ Test with traversal attempt: `get_note_path("../../../etc/passwd", "id")` → raises ValueError
3. ✅ Verify resolved path is canonical: `resolved_path.is_relative_to(BASE_DIR.resolve())` → True for legitimate paths

## Core CRUD Functions

Now let's implement the functions that handle data persistence. These are the workhorses of the application—they orchestrate file I/O, error handling, and JSON operations.

### Code Example 5.2: Complete CRUD Functions

```python
from pathlib import Path
import json
from typing import Optional
import uuid
from datetime import datetime

BASE_DIR: Path = Path("notes")

def get_all_notes() -> list[dict]:
    """
    Load all notes from files in the notes/ directory.

    Uses glob() to find all .json files recursively across all categories.
    Handles corrupted files gracefully with error messages.
    """
    notes: list[dict] = []

    for json_file in BASE_DIR.glob("**/*.json"):
        try:
            with open(json_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                note = json.load(f)
                notes.append(note)
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            print(f"⚠️  Warning: Corrupted note file {json_file.name} - skipping")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"⚠️  Error reading {json_file.name}: {e}")

    return notes


def save_note(note: dict) -> bool:
    """
    Save or update a note to disk.

    Takes a note dictionary, extracts category and ID, creates the directory
    if needed, and writes to JSON file with UTF-8 encoding and formatting.
    """
    try:
        category = note.get("category", "personal")
        note_id = note.get("id")

        if not note_id:
            print("Error: Note must have an id")
            return False

        # Create category directory if it doesn't exist
        note_dir: Path = BASE_DIR / category
        note_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

        # Write note to file
        note_path: Path = note_dir / f"{note_id}.json"
        with open(note_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            json.dump(note, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)

        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Error saving note: {e}")
        return False


def search_notes(keyword: str) -> list[dict]:
    """
    Find all notes containing keyword in title or body (case-insensitive).

    Loads all notes, filters by searching title and body fields,
    returns list of matching notes.
    """
    all_notes = get_all_notes()
    keyword_lower = keyword.lower()

    matching: list[dict] = [
        note for note in all_notes
        if keyword_lower in note.get("title", "").lower() or
           keyword_lower in note.get("body", "").lower()
    ]

    return matching


def delete_note(note_id: str) -> bool:
    """
    Delete a note by ID.

    Finds the note in all notes (to get category), then deletes the
    corresponding file. Returns True if successful, False otherwise.
    """
    try:
        all_notes = get_all_notes()

        for note in all_notes:
            if note["id"] == note_id:
                category = note.get("category", "personal")
                note_file: Path = BASE_DIR / category / f"{note_id}.json"

                if note_file.exists():
                    note_file.unlink()  # Delete file
                    return True

        return False  # Note not found
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Error deleting note: {e}")
        return False


def get_note_by_id(note_id: str) -> Optional[dict]:
    """Helper: Find a single note by ID."""
    all_notes = get_all_notes()
    for note in all_notes:
        if note["id"] == note_id:
            return note
    return None
```

**Specification Reference**: Lessons 2, 3, 4 - file I/O, pathlib directory creation, JSON serialization

**Prompts Used**:
1. "Write a function that loads all JSON files from nested directories using glob()"
2. "Implement save_note that creates directories if needed and writes with UTF-8 encoding"
3. "Write a search function that finds notes by keyword in title or body"

**Validation Steps**:
1. ✅ Load 3+ notes from different categories → `get_all_notes()` returns all
2. ✅ Save new note → file created in correct category directory with proper JSON formatting
3. ✅ Search finds matches → `search_notes("python")` returns notes with "python" in title/body
4. ✅ Delete removes file → `delete_note(id)` removes file and returns True
5. ✅ Error handling → corrupted JSON shows warning but doesn't crash

#### 🚀 CoLearning Challenge

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:

> "My app is slow when I have 1000 notes—every operation loads all notes from disk. How would you optimize this? What data structure would help? When would you use in-memory caching?"

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand performance trade-offs and scaling patterns beyond this capstone's 10-50 note scope.

## Menu Loop Implementation

The menu loop is where user interaction happens. It displays options, accepts input with validation, routes to appropriate functions, and returns to menu after each operation.

### Code Example 5.3: Complete Application Menu Loop

```python
import uuid
from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path
import json

# [CRUD functions from Example 5.2 would be included here]

    body: str = input("Body: ").strip()
    category: str = input("Category (work/personal/learning) [personal]: ").strip() or "personal"

    # Validate input
    if not title or not body:
        print("❌ Error: Title and body cannot be empty.")
        return

    # Create note dictionary
    note: dict = {

    }

    # Save note

            elif choice == 7:
                print("\n👋 Goodbye! Your notes are saved.")
                break

        except ValueError:
            print("❌ Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 7.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"❌ Unexpected error: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Specification Reference**: Lessons 1, 2, 3, 4 - all I/O concepts combined

**Prompts Used**:
1. "Write a menu loop that displays options 1-7 and validates user input"
2. "Create functions for each CRUD operation with error handling"
3. "Implement search that finds notes by keyword"

**Validation Steps**:
1. ✅ Menu displays and accepts 1-7 → invalid input shows error and re-prompts
2. ✅ Create note → prompts for title/body/category, saves to file, returns to menu
3. ✅ Read note → lists notes, accepts selection, displays selected note, returns to menu
4. ✅ Update note → allows changing title/body, updates timestamp, returns to menu
5. ✅ Delete note → requires confirmation before removing file
6. ✅ Search → finds notes by keyword, shows results
7. ✅ List → shows all notes grouped by category
8. ✅ Exit → graceful shutdown with goodbye message

#### ✨ Teaching Tip

Use Claude Code to test edge cases in your implementation:

> "What happens if I create a note with an empty title? Or try to delete a note twice? Show me each error and how my code should handle it."

## Error Handling and Validation

Production-quality applications handle errors gracefully. Let's review the validation patterns used throughout:

### Input Validation (Lesson 1 Pattern)
```python
# Menu choice validation
try:
    choice: int = int(input("Enter choice (1-7): ").strip())
    if choice not in range(1, 8):
        print("Invalid choice. Please enter 1-7.")
        continue
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
```

### File Operation Errors (Lesson 2 Pattern)
```python
# Handle missing/corrupted files
try:
    with open(note_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        note = json.load(f)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found")
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    print("File is corrupted")
```

### Path Safety (Lesson 3 Pattern)
```python
# Prevent directory traversal
requested_path = (BASE_DIR / user_input).resolve()
if not requested_path.is_relative_to(BASE_DIR.resolve()):
    raise ValueError("Security error: Path outside allowed directory")
```

### Data Validation
```python
# Ensure required fields exist
if not title or not body:
    print("Error: Title and body cannot be empty.")
    return
```

## Testing and Refinement

### How to Test Your Application

1. **Test Create**: Run the app, select "Create Note", enter a title and body, verify file is created
   ```bash
   $ ls notes/personal/
   # Should show one or more .json files
   ```

2. **Test Read**: Select "Read Note", choose one from the list, verify it displays correctly

3. **Test Update**: Select "Update Note", change the title, verify file is updated

4. **Test Delete**: Create a note, delete it, verify file is removed

5. **Test Search**: Create notes with different keywords, search for them, verify results

6. **Test Menu Loop**: Go through several operations, verify app returns to menu each time

7. **Test Error Handling**:
   - Enter invalid menu choice → should show error and re-prompt
   - Try to read notes when none exist → should show "No notes found"
   - Try to delete non-existent note → should handle gracefully

### Edge Cases to Consider

- What happens if someone creates a note with Unicode emoji? (UTF-8 should preserve it)
- What if the notes/ directory is deleted while the app is running? (mkdir will recreate it)
- What if someone has 50 notes—does the app still respond quickly? (Yes, file-per-note is efficient)
- What if you edit a note file manually while the app is running? (Next read will get latest version)

#### 🎓 Instructor Commentary

> In AI-native development, you don't test by hand 50 times—you test strategically. Your AI can help generate test cases: "What edge cases should I test for a note-taking app?" Then you verify each one systematically.

## Project Deliverables

Your complete application should consist of:

1. **Main Application File** (e.g., `note_app.py` or `main.py`)
   - Imports all necessary modules
   - Defines BASE_DIR and initializes directories
   - Implements all CRUD functions
   - Implements menu loop with input validation
   - Has `if __name__ == "__main__"` guard with `main()` call

2. **Data Directory** (`notes/`)
   - Automatically created when app runs
   - Contains category subdirectories (work, personal, learning)
   - Stores notes as JSON files organized by category

3. **Working Features** - All of these must function:
   - Menu displays correctly
   - Create note saves to JSON file
   - Read note loads and displays from file
   - Update note modifies file and updates timestamp
   - Delete note removes file after confirmation
   - Search finds notes by keyword
   - List displays notes organized by category
   - Exit closes app gracefully

### Success Criteria Checklist

Your application is complete when:

- ✅ Application runs without crashing on valid input
- ✅ All CRUD operations work correctly
- ✅ User input is validated (menu choices, required fields)
- ✅ Notes persist between sessions (data saved to JSON files)
- ✅ Search finds notes by keyword in title or body
- ✅ Application handles errors gracefully (missing files, corrupted JSON)
- ✅ Code is organized with functions for each operation
- ✅ Application supports 10-50 notes at responsive speed
- ✅ Menu returns to top after each operation

## Try With AI

The following prompts guide you through building and extending this capstone project. Use them in your AI tool (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or ChatGPT) to explore concepts and validate your work.

### Prompt 1: Understand Architecture (Remember/Understand)

**Ask your AI**: "Show me the overall architecture of a note-taking app. What are the main components (menu loop, CRUD functions, data structure, file organization) and how do they interact with each other?"

**Expected Outcome**: You'll get a clear picture of how the pieces fit together before writing code. Understanding architecture prevents design mistakes.

---

### Prompt 2: Implement Menu Loop (Apply)

**Ask your AI**: "Write the main menu loop that displays options 1-7 and calls different functions based on user input. Add input validation to reject invalid choices and handle errors gracefully."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll see how menu dispatch works—accepting input, validating it, routing to functions, and returning to menu. This is the "control flow" of the application.

---

### Prompt 3: Analyze Data Structure Decisions (Analyze)

**Ask your AI**: "I'm building a note-taking app and deciding: should I store all notes in one JSON file or create one file per note? Compare these approaches. Which is better and why? What are the performance implications?"

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand that file-per-note is better for this scale (10-50 notes) because:
- Each note is independent (easier to update/delete)
- Disk I/O is proportional to number of operations (not total data)
- Categories naturally map to directories
- Scaling to hundreds of notes remains responsive

---

### Prompt 4: Design Complete Application (Synthesize/Create)

**Ask your AI**: "Design a complete Note-Taking app with Create/Read/Update/Delete operations. Walk me through the application flow: user sees menu → selects option → app responds → returns to menu. What data structures do we need? What error cases must we handle? Show me the overall code structure."

**Expected Outcome**: Cognitive closure. You'll integrate all Chapter 22 I/O concepts into a production-quality application demonstrating mastery. You're ready to build file-based CLI applications in your professional work and ready for Chapters 23+ (datetime operations, OOP, etc.).

---

**Congratulations!** You've completed the Note-Taking App capstone, integrating all I/O concepts from Chapter 22. Your application demonstrates professional-level CLI development using Python 3.14+, pathlib, JSON, file I/O, and menu-driven interaction. You're now ready to extend this pattern to larger applications and real-world projects.
