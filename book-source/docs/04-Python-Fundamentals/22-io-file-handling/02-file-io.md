# Lesson 2: File I/O Fundamentals with Context Managers

## Why Files Matter: From Console to Persistent Storage

So far, you've learned how to gather input from users and display output on the console. But there's a fundamental problem with console interaction: **everything disappears when the program ends**. When you close your terminal, all the data vanishes.

In the real world, applications need to **persist data**—save it in a way that survives beyond the program's execution. That's where files come in. A file is simply data stored on your computer's disk that exists independently of any running program. Think of it like the difference between writing a message on a whiteboard (console—temporary) versus writing it in a notebook (file—persistent).

This lesson teaches you how to safely read from and write to files using Python's most important file-handling pattern: **context managers**. By the end of this lesson, you'll understand why context managers matter and how to use them to prevent data loss and resource leaks.

## Concept: Context Managers and Why They're Essential

Let's start with the most important pattern in file I/O: the **context manager**, accessed using Python's `with` statement.

### The Problem: What Happens Without Context Managers

Without context managers, you might open a file like this:

```python
# DANGEROUS: Don't do this (for illustration only)
file = open("notes.txt", 'r')
content = file.read()
file.close()  # Easy to forget!
```

This approach has serious problems:

- **Easy to forget closing**: If your code crashes or takes an unexpected path, the `file.close()` might never execute
- **Resource leaks**: The operating system tracks open files. Leave too many open, and your program crashes
- **Data corruption**: Writing to files without properly closing them can lose data

### The Solution: Context Managers with `with`

Context managers automatically handle setup and cleanup:

```python
# SAFE: Always use this pattern
with open("notes.txt", 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    content = file.read()
    # File is automatically closed here, even if error occurs
```

**Three crucial points**:

1. **Automatic cleanup**: The `with` statement guarantees the file closes, even if an error occurs
2. **Cleaner syntax**: Less boilerplate code than manual open/close
3. **Exception safe**: If an exception is raised inside the block, the file still closes properly

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "Explain what happens if I forget the `with` statement and use `file = open(filename)` then try to read it. Why is `with` safer?"

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand context manager benefits—guaranteed cleanup that prevents file corruption.

---

## Concept: File Modes Explained

Every time you open a file, you must specify a **file mode** that determines what you're allowed to do:

| Mode | Name | Behavior | File State |
|------|------|----------|-----------|
| `'r'` | Read | Read existing file | File must exist; not modified |
| `'w'` | Write | Create new or overwrite | Existing content deleted; creates if doesn't exist |
| `'a'` | Append | Add to end of file | Existing content preserved; creates if doesn't exist |
| `'r+'` | Read + Write | Read and modify in place | File must exist; position matters |

**Critical difference**: `'w'` **deletes** existing content. If the file exists and you open it in write mode, everything gets erased immediately.

Let me show you what this means in practice:

```python
# File initially doesn't exist
# Open in write mode → file is created
with open("example.txt", 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write("First line\n")
    f.write("Second line\n")
# File now contains 2 lines

# Open same file in write mode again → **content is deleted**
with open("example.txt", 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write("New content\n")
# File now contains only the new content (previous data is gone!)

# Open in append mode → add without deleting
with open("example.txt", 'a', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write("Appended line\n")
# File now contains: "New content\n" + "Appended line\n"
```

#### 🎓 Instructor Commentary

> In AI-native development, you don't memorize file mode combinations—you understand your INTENT (create new, append, read, modify). Ask AI: "I want to add lines to an existing file without losing data—which mode?" Your job: specify intent; syntax is cheap.

---

## Concept: Reading Methods—Different Approaches for Different Needs

Python provides three ways to read file content, each with different purposes:

### `read()` — Read Entire File at Once

```python
with open("notes.txt", 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    content: str = f.read()
    # content is now a single string containing entire file
    print(content)
```

**Use when**: You want the entire file as one string; file is small enough to fit in memory.

### `readline()` — Read One Line at a Time

```python
with open("notes.txt", 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    line1: str = f.readline()  # "First line\n"
    line2: str = f.readline()  # "Second line\n"
    line3: str = f.readline()  # "Third line\n"
```

**Use when**: You want to process the file line-by-line; useful for large files.

### `readlines()` — Read All Lines into a List

```python
with open("notes.txt", 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    lines: list[str] = f.readlines()
    # lines = ["First line\n", "Second line\n", "Third line\n"]
    for line in lines:
        print(f"Line: {line.strip()}")  # strip() removes \n
```

**Use when**: You want all lines as a list but want to iterate or process them later.

**Note on newlines**: Each line from `readline()` and `readlines()` includes the trailing `\n`. Use `.strip()` to remove it:

```python
with open("notes.txt", 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    for line in f:  # You can iterate directly
        clean_line: str = line.strip()
        print(f"Content: {clean_line}")
```

#### 🚀 CoLearning Challenge

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:

> "I have a 1GB log file. I need to find all lines containing 'ERROR'. Why would `readlines()` be a bad choice? How would I process it more efficiently?"

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand memory implications and learn to iterate file directly.

---

## Concept: Writing Files with Proper Formatting

Writing to files requires careful attention to **newlines**. Unlike `print()` which automatically adds `\n`, the `write()` method writes exactly what you give it:

```python
# Without explicit newlines, everything runs together
with open("output.txt", 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write("Line 1")      # No newline!
    f.write("Line 2")      # These concatenate
    f.write("Line 3")

# File contents: "Line 1Line 2Line 3" (all on one line)
```

**Correct approach**: Always include `'\n'` explicitly:

```python
with open("output.txt", 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write("Line 1\n")
    f.write("Line 2\n")
    f.write("Line 3\n")

# File contents:
# Line 1
# Line 2
# Line 3
```

For multiple lines, use `writelines()`:

```python
lines: list[str] = [
    "First note\n",
    "Second note\n",
    "Third note\n",
]

with open("notes.txt", 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.writelines(lines)
```

---

## Concept: File Exceptions—Handling Errors Gracefully

When working with files, several errors can occur. The most common are:

### `FileNotFoundError`

Raised when you try to open a file that doesn't exist:

```python
with open("nonexistent.txt", 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    content = f.read()
# Raises: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'nonexistent.txt'
```

### `PermissionError`

Raised when you don't have permission to read or write a file:

```python
with open("/root/private.txt", 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    content = f.read()
# Raises: PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/root/private.txt'
```

### `IOError`

Generic I/O error (read errors, disk full, etc.):

```python
# Disk full, or other I/O issue
with open("bigfile.txt", 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write("x" * 10000000)
# Raises: IOError: No space left on device
```

**Always wrap file operations in try/except**:

```python
try:
    with open("data.txt", 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        content = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: File not found. Creating a new one.")
    with open("data.txt", 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write("Initial content\n")
except PermissionError:
    print("Error: You don't have permission to read this file.")
except IOError as e:
    print(f"Error reading file: {e}")
```

#### ✨ Teaching Tip

> Use Claude Code to explore file errors: "What happens if I try to open a file that doesn't exist? Show me the actual error and how to handle it gracefully."

## Code Examples

### Code Example 2.1: Safe File Reading with Context Manager

**Specification Reference**: Demonstrate safe file reading with automatic cleanup; handle FileNotFoundError
**AI Prompt Used**: "Show me how to safely open and read a text file with error handling"

```python
def read_file_safely(filename: str) -> str | None:
    """Read file contents safely, return None if file doesn't exist."""
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            content: str = file.read()
            print(f"Successfully read {len(content)} characters from {filename}")
            return content
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{filename}' not found.")
        return None
    except IOError as e:
        print(f"Error reading file: {e}")
        return None


# Test
result: str | None = read_file_safely("notes.txt")
if result:
    print(f"Content:\n{result}")
else:
    print("Could not read file")
```

**Validation Steps**:
- ✓ Context manager (`with` statement) ensures file is closed
- ✓ Exception handling catches both missing files and I/O errors
- ✓ Returns meaningful data (`str | None` type hint)
- ✓ Function is reusable across different filenames

---

### Code Example 2.2: Different File Modes and Reading Methods

**Specification Reference**: Demonstrate write mode, multiple reading methods, newline handling
**AI Prompt Used**: "Show me how to write a file with multiple lines, then read it back in different ways"

```python
# Create a sample file with multiple lines
filename: str = "data.txt"

# WRITE MODE: Create new file or overwrite existing
with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write("Alice,25,Engineering\n")
    f.write("Bob,30,Sales\n")
    f.write("Carol,28,Marketing\n")

print(f"Created {filename} with 3 lines\n")

# METHOD 1: read() - entire file as one string
print("=== Using read() ===")
with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    full_content: str = f.read()
    print(f"File contents:\n{full_content}")

# METHOD 2: readline() - one line at a time
print("=== Using readline() ===")
with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    line1: str = f.readline().strip()  # strip() removes \n
    line2: str = f.readline().strip()
    line3: str = f.readline().strip()
    print(f"Line 1: {line1}")
    print(f"Line 2: {line2}")
    print(f"Line 3: {line3}")

# METHOD 3: readlines() - all lines as list
print("=== Using readlines() ===")
with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    lines: list[str] = f.readlines()
    print(f"Total lines: {len(lines)}")
    for i, line in enumerate(lines, 1):
        print(f"  Line {i}: {line.strip()}")

# METHOD 4: iterate directly (most Pythonic)
print("=== Iterating directly ===")
with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    for i, line in enumerate(f, 1):
        name, age, dept = line.strip().split(',')
        print(f"  {i}. {name} ({age}) - {dept}")
```

**Output**:
```
Created data.txt with 3 lines

=== Using read() ===
File contents:
Alice,25,Engineering
Bob,30,Sales
Carol,28,Marketing

=== Using readline() ===
Line 1: Alice,25,Engineering
Line 2: Bob,30,Sales
Line 3: Carol,28,Marketing

=== Using readlines() ===
Total lines: 3
  Line 1: Alice,25,Engineering
  Line 2: Bob,30,Sales
  Line 3: Carol,28,Marketing

=== Iterating directly ===
  1. Alice (25) - Engineering
  2. Bob (30) - Sales
  3. Carol (28) - Marketing
```

**Validation Steps**:
- ✓ Write mode creates file with multiple lines
- ✓ All four reading methods produce correct output
- ✓ Newline handling works correctly (`.strip()` removes `\n`)
- ✓ Direct iteration is most efficient

---

### Code Example 2.3: Append Mode and File Growth

**Specification Reference**: Demonstrate append mode, contrast with write mode, show log file pattern
**AI Prompt Used**: "Show me how to add lines to a file without deleting existing content"

```python
filename: str = "log.txt"

# INITIAL WRITE: Create the log file
print("=== Creating log file ===")
with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write("2025-11-09 10:00 - Program started\n")
    f.write("2025-11-09 10:05 - User login\n")

print("Log file created with 2 entries")

# READ to show current state
with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    print(f"\nCurrent log:\n{f.read()}")

# APPEND MODE: Add more entries without deleting
print("=== Appending new entries ===")
with open(filename, 'a', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write("2025-11-09 10:15 - Data processing started\n")
    f.write("2025-11-09 10:30 - Data processing complete\n")
    f.write("2025-11-09 10:35 - Program ended\n")

print("Added 3 new entries")

# READ final state
print("\nFinal log:")
with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    for i, line in enumerate(f, 1):
        print(f"  {i}. {line.strip()}")
```

**Output**:
```
=== Creating log file ===
Log file created with 2 entries

Current log:
2025-11-09 10:00 - Program started
2025-11-09 10:05 - User login

=== Appending new entries ===
Added 3 new entries

Final log:
  1. 2025-11-09 10:00 - Program started
  2. 2025-11-09 10:05 - User login
  3. 2025-11-09 10:15 - Data processing started
  4. 2025-11-09 10:30 - Data processing complete
  5. 2025-11-09 10:35 - Program ended
```

**Validation Steps**:
- ✓ Write mode creates file; append mode adds to existing content
- ✓ File grows correctly with each append operation
- ✓ All entries are preserved (not overwritten)
- ✓ Perfect pattern for application logs

### Code Example 2.4: Comprehensive Error Handling for File Operations

**Specification Reference**: Show proper exception handling for common file errors
**AI Prompt Used**: "Write a function that reads a file with proper error handling for different failure cases"

```python
def safe_read_file(filename: str) -> str | None:
    """
    Read file with comprehensive error handling.

    Returns:
        File contents as string, or None if error occurs
    """
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            content: str = f.read()
            return content

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{filename}' not found.")
        print("  Make sure the file exists in the current directory.")
        return None

    except PermissionError:
        print(f"Error: No permission to read '{filename}'.")
        print("  Check file permissions (you may need admin access).")
        return None

    except IOError as e:
        print(f"Error reading file: {e}")
        print("  This could be a disk error or encoding issue.")
        return None


def safe_write_file(filename: str, content: str) -> bool:
    """
    Write content to file with error handling.

    Returns:
        True if successful, False if error occurred
    """
    try:
        with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            f.write(content)
        print(f"Successfully wrote to '{filename}'")
        return True

    except PermissionError:
        print(f"Error: No permission to write '{filename}'.")
        return False

    except IOError as e:
        print(f"Error writing file: {e}")
        return False


# Test reading non-existent file
print("=== Attempting to read missing file ===")
result: str | None = safe_read_file("nonexistent.txt")
if result:
    print(f"Content: {result}")
else:
    print("Read failed\n")

# Test writing and reading back
print("=== Write and read test ===")
test_content: str = "Hello from Python!\nThis file was created safely.\n"
success: bool = safe_write_file("test.txt", test_content)

if success:
    result = safe_read_file("test.txt")
    if result:
        print(f"Verified content:\n{result}")
```

**Output**:
```
=== Attempting to read missing file ===
Error: File 'nonexistent.txt' not found.
  Make sure the file exists in the current directory.
Read failed

=== Write and read test ===
Successfully wrote to 'test.txt'
Verified content:
Hello from Python!
This file was created safely.
```

**Validation Steps**:
- ✓ Catches FileNotFoundError with helpful message
- ✓ Catches PermissionError separately with different guidance
- ✓ Catches generic IOError for other issues
- ✓ Type hints (`str | None`, `-> bool`) make behavior clear
- ✓ Reusable functions work across different filenames
- ✓ Returns meaningful data indicating success/failure

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create, Write, and Read Files

Write a program that:
1. Creates a file called `inventory.txt`
2. Writes the names of 5 products with quantities
3. Reads the file back and displays each line with a line number

**Example Output**:
```
Created inventory.txt with 5 products

Inventory:
  1. Apples - 25 units
  2. Bananas - 18 units
  3. Oranges - 12 units
  4. Grapes - 8 units
  5. Strawberries - 15 units
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- File contains exactly 5 lines
- Each line has product name and quantity
- Output shows line numbers with proper formatting
- Uses context managers for all file operations

---

### Exercise 2: Append Mode and Log Files

Write a program that:
1. Creates a `session.log` file with one initial entry
2. Appends 3 more entries with timestamps
3. Reads and displays the complete log

**Example Output**:
```
Log file created
2025-11-09 09:00 - Session started

Log updated with 3 new entries

Complete log:
  2025-11-09 09:00 - Session started
  2025-11-09 09:15 - User action 1
  2025-11-09 09:30 - User action 2
  2025-11-09 09:45 - Session ended
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Initial write creates file
- Append operations add to file without deleting
- All entries displayed in order
- Works correctly on first run (file doesn't exist yet) and subsequent runs

---

### Exercise 3: Error Handling for File Operations

Write a program that:
1. Attempts to read a file that might not exist
2. Handles FileNotFoundError by creating the file with default content
3. Reads the file and displays it

**Example Output**:
```
File 'config.txt' not found. Creating with defaults...
Default config created

Current config:
  debug=false
  timeout=30
  retries=3
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Catches FileNotFoundError
- Creates new file with default content
- Reads and displays file on second try
- Uses appropriate try/except blocks

---

## Try With AI

### Prompt 1: Remember/Understand

Ask your AI: "What is a context manager? Why do we use the `with` statement when opening files?"

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand that context managers automatically clean up resources, preventing file corruption and resource leaks.

---

### Prompt 2: Apply

Ask your AI: "Write a program that reads a file containing CSV data (each line has name,age,city), parses it, and writes a formatted report to a new file."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll see file reading, string parsing, and writing combined in a practical workflow.

---

### Prompt 3: Analyze

Ask your AI: "Compare reading a file with `read()` vs `readlines()`. When would you use each? What are the memory implications for large files?"

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand performance tradeoffs and method selection criteria based on file size and use case.

---

### Prompt 4: Synthesize/Create

Ask your AI: "Design a file backup program that reads the original file, makes modifications (e.g., removing blank lines), and writes to a backup file. Include error handling for missing files and write failures. What's the overall structure?"

**Expected Outcome**: You'll see how file I/O integrates with data processing and error management at application level, preparing you for Lesson 5 capstone.
