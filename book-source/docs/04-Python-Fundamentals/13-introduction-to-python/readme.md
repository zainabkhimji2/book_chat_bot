# Chapter 13: Introduction to Modern Python

Welcome to your first hands-on Python chapter! You've spent Chapters 1–12 learning the philosophy and tools of AI-Driven Development. Now it's time to apply that philosophy to Python programming. This chapter isn't about memorizing Python syntax—it's about understanding Python as a tool for describing intent that AI agents can execute.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have installed Python, written your first typed variables and programs, and built an interactive capstone project that integrates everything you've learned. Most importantly, you'll understand how to use Python with AI collaboration: you describe what you want your code to do (using type hints and clear specifications), your AI partner helps you explore and implement, and you validate the results.

This chapter applies the AI-Native Learning methodology throughout: you'll explore concepts with your AI companion (Claude Code or Gemini CLI), validate your understanding through hands-on practice, and learn from errors with AI's help.

## What You'll Learn

- **What Is Python?** Understand Python as the language of AI-driven development and why it matters for building AI agents
- **Installing Python 3.14+** Set up a working Python environment on Windows, Mac, or Linux with AI assistance for troubleshooting
- **Variables and Type Hints** Create typed variables that describe intent clearly, preparing for specification-first thinking
- **Basic Syntax and Programs** Write and run Python programs using indentation, comments, print statements, and f-strings
- **Capstone Project** Build an interactive program that collects and validates user information, demonstrating all Chapter 13 concepts

## Before You Start

**Prerequisites**:
- You've completed Chapter 12 (Python UV package manager basics)
- You have terminal/command-line access from Chapter 7 (Bash Essentials)
- You have Claude Code or Gemini CLI installed from Chapters 5–6
- You're comfortable with AI collaboration and prompt engineering from Chapters 10–11
- **No prior Python knowledge required**—this chapter assumes zero programming experience

**What You'll Need**:
- A computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- Internet connection for Python download and AI tool access
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, Cursor, or any code editor)
- Your AI companion tool (Claude Code or Gemini CLI)

## How This Chapter Works

This is a **5-lesson progression** from understanding to application:

1. **Lesson 1** (40 min): What Is Python? — Build conceptual understanding
2. **Lesson 2** (60–90 min): Installing Python 3.14+ — Get your environment working
3. **Lesson 3** (75 min): Variables and Type Hints — Learn your first Python syntax
4. **Lesson 4** (75 min): Basic Syntax and Programs — Write and run your first programs
5. **Lesson 5** (90 min): Capstone Project — Build an interactive program integrating all concepts

**Total Time**: 4–5 hours of learning

## The AI-Native Learning Pattern

Throughout this chapter, you'll follow the same pattern professional developers use with AI:

1. **Describe Intent** — Specify what you want your code to do (using type hints and clear names)
2. **Explore with AI** — Ask your AI companion to explain concepts, review your code, suggest improvements
3. **Validate Understanding** — Run programs, see results, understand how they work
4. **Learn from Errors** — When something breaks, ask AI "What went wrong and why?"

This pattern teaches two skills simultaneously: Python fundamentals AND how to work effectively with AI tools.

## Key Philosophy: Type Hints Are Core, Not Optional

In traditional Python courses, type hints are an optional, advanced topic. **Not here.** Type hints are core to how we teach Python because they're core to AI-Driven Development.

**Type hints describe your intent**: `age: int = 25` tells both humans and AI "I want age to hold a whole number." This clarity is how AI agents understand what you're building.

Every variable in this chapter includes a type hint. This isn't busywork—it's practicing specification-first thinking that prepares you for Spec-Driven Development in Part 5.

## Connection to AIDD Methodology

You learned in Chapters 1–4 that AI-Driven Development is about describing intent that AI can execute. You learned tools (Chapters 5–8) and techniques (Chapters 9–11). Now you're learning Python as the language for expressing that intent.

- **Type hints** (Lesson 3) are how you describe intent about data
- **Specifications** in Lesson 5's capstone show how to design before coding
- **"Try With AI" sections** throughout apply the prompt engineering and context engineering skills from Chapters 10–11

By the end of Chapter 13, you'll see Python not as "a programming language to memorize" but as "a specification language for AI agents to understand and execute."

## What We're NOT Covering (Yet)

This chapter is focused and intentional. We're **not** teaching:
- **Control Flow** (if/else, for loops) — Chapters 16–17
- **Functions** (def, parameters, returns) — Chapter 19
- **Object-Oriented Programming** (classes, objects) — Chapter 21
- **Collections** (lists, dictionaries) — Chapters 18–19

We focus on **variables, type hints, and basic syntax**. Everything else builds on this foundation.
