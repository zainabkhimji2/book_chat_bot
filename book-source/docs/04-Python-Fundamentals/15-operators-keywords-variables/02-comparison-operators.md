# Comparison Operators — Making True/False Decisions

Now that you can do math with arithmetic operators, it's time to ask questions. Can I compare two values? Is 10 bigger than 5? Are these two numbers the same? Comparison operators let you answer these questions. Instead of doing math and getting a number back, comparisons return True or False—answers to yes/no questions.

Think of comparison operators like a referee in a game: they look at two things, make a judgment, and give you an answer: "True" (yes, this condition is met) or "False" (no, it's not).

## What It Is: Asking True/False Questions

A **comparison operator** evaluates whether a condition is true or false. When you write `5 > 3`, you're asking Python: "Is 5 greater than 3?" Python answers: "True."

Python has **six comparison operators**:

- `==` **Equality** — Are these values the same?
- `!=` **Not equal** — Are these values different?
- `>` **Greater than** — Is the left side bigger?
- `<` **Less than** — Is the left side smaller?
- `>=` **Greater than or equal** — Is the left side bigger or the same?
- `<=` **Less than or equal** — Is the left side smaller or the same?

All comparisons return a **boolean value**: either `True` or `False`. This is different from arithmetic operators, which return numbers. Comparisons return yes/no answers.

## The Six Comparison Operators

Let's see all six in action. Each one asks a different question about two values.

### Equality and Inequality: Are They the Same?

```python
# Equality: asking if values are the same
x: int = 10
y: int = 5

equal: bool = x == y            # False - 10 is not equal to 5
print(f"{x} == {y}: {equal}")   # 10 == 5: False

# Inequality: asking if values are different
not_equal: bool = x != y        # True - 10 is different from 5
print(f"{x} != {y}: {not_equal}")  # 10 != 5: True

# Type verification - comparisons return bool
print(f"Type of result: {type(equal)}")  # <class 'bool'>
```

Important distinction: In Lesson 1, we saw that `=` assigns a value to a variable. Here, `==` compares two values. One `=` stores; two `==` compare. This is a common mistake, so remember it well.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "Why does Python use = for assignment but == for equality checking? Compare this to other programming languages. Why is this distinction important?"

Notice that we're asking AI to explain the **design choice** behind the operators, not just what they do. This helps you understand Python's thinking, not memorize syntax.

### Magnitude Comparisons: Which is Bigger?

```python
# Greater than and less than
x: int = 10
y: int = 5

greater: bool = x > y           # True - 10 is greater than 5
print(f"{x} > {y}: {greater}")  # 10 > 5: True

less: bool = x < y              # False - 10 is NOT less than 5
print(f"{x} < {y}: {less}")     # 10 < 5: False

# Greater than or equal, less than or equal
greater_equal: bool = x >= y    # True - 10 is greater than or equal to 5
print(f"{x} >= {y}: {greater_equal}")  # 10 >= 5: True

less_equal: bool = x <= y       # False - 10 is NOT less than or equal to 5
print(f"{x} <= {y}: {less_equal}")     # 10 <= 5: False

# What about comparing a value with itself?
same: bool = x >= x             # True - 10 is equal to 10
print(f"{x} >= {x}: {same}")    # 10 >= 10: True
```

The operators `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` compare magnitude—which value is bigger. They answer: "Is the left side bigger, smaller, or equal?" The `=` in `>=` and `<=` means "or equal to," so `10 >= 10` is True (they're equal).

#### 🎓 Instructor Commentary

> In AI-native development, you don't memorize the difference between `>` and `>=`. You think: "Do I want to include the equal case or not?" Then you use the operator that matches your intent. If you're uncertain, you ask AI: "Should I use > or >= here?" and let AI help you reason through the condition.

### Value Equality vs. Type Equality

Here's something that surprises many beginners: Python compares **values**, not types.

```python
# Integer 5 and float 5.0 are VALUE-equal (but different types)
int_five: int = 5
float_five: float = 5.0

# These have different types
type_different: bool = type(int_five) != type(float_five)  # True - types differ
print(f"Types are different: {type_different}")  # True

# But the VALUES are equal
values_equal: bool = int_five == float_five     # True - values are the same
print(f"Values are equal: {values_equal}")      # True

# String "5" is NOT equal to integer 5
string_five: str = "5"
string_int_compare: bool = int_five == string_five  # False - different types AND values

print(f"5 == 5.0: {int_five == float_five}")   # True (value equality)
print(f"5 == '5': {int_five == string_five}")  # False (different types)
```

This is crucial: `5 == 5.0` returns True because the **values** are the same, even though one is int and one is float. But `5 == "5"` returns False because "5" is text, not a number.

#### 🚀 CoLearning Challenge

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:

> "I'm confused about why 5 == 5.0 is True, but 5 == '5' is False. Explain value equality vs. type equality. When does Python care about types vs. just values in comparisons?"

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand that `==` checks if values are the same (regardless of type in most cases), but type mismatches between completely different types (int vs. string) make them not equal. You'll see how Python's flexibility can be useful but also requires careful thinking.

### Comparisons in Real Scenarios

```python
# Real scenario: Checking age eligibility
user_age: int = 16
voting_age: int = 18
driving_age: int = 16

can_vote: bool = user_age >= voting_age       # False (16 is not >= 18)
can_drive: bool = user_age >= driving_age     # True (16 is >= 16)

print(f"Can vote: {can_vote}")                 # False
print(f"Can drive: {can_drive}")               # True

# Another real scenario: Password length
password: str = "SecurePass123"
min_length: int = 8

is_long_enough: bool = len(password) >= min_length  # True
print(f"Password meets length requirement: {is_long_enough}")

# Checking if values are in a specific range (prepare for logical operators in Lesson 3)
test_score: int = 85
passing_score: int = 70
perfect_score: int = 100

is_passing: bool = test_score >= passing_score  # True
is_perfect: bool = test_score == perfect_score  # False
is_valid: bool = test_score <= perfect_score    # True (score can't exceed 100)
```

#### ✨ Teaching Tip

> Use your AI tool to explore edge cases: "What happens if I compare None with 0? Show me the error or result, and explain what's happening."

## Why Comparisons Matter for Chapter 17

You might wonder: "Why are we learning comparisons separately from if statements?" The answer is that comparisons are **building blocks**. In Chapter 17, you'll learn control flow: making decisions with `if` statements. When you write `if x > 5:`, that `x > 5` is a comparison operator at work. By mastering comparisons now, Chapter 17 will feel natural—you'll already understand how to ask True/False questions.

## Try With AI

Now it's your turn to explore comparison operators with an AI co-teacher. These prompts build from understanding to application to edge cases to synthesis.

**Tool Choice**: Use Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or ChatGPT web—whatever you have access to.

### Prompt 1: Concept Exploration (Understand)

Copy and ask your AI:

> "I'm learning comparison operators in Python.
> - What do `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` do?
> - Why does Python use `==` for comparison but `=` for assignment?
> - Show me examples of each operator with numbers and explain True/False results."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand what each comparison operator does; clearly distinguish = (assignment) from == (equality test); see that comparisons produce True/False answers.

---

### Prompt 2: Application (Apply)

Copy and ask your AI:

> "Write Python code that checks if a user can buy a movie ticket.
> - movie_age_rating = 13
> - user_age = 12
>
> Write a comparison that checks if user_age >= movie_age_rating.
> Is the result True or False? Explain the logic using the comparison operator."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll apply comparison operators to realistic problems; understand how conditions work in real scenarios; predict results correctly before running code.

---

### Prompt 3: Edge Case Discovery (Explore)

Copy and ask your AI:

> "I noticed something weird about comparisons. Try these:
> - 5 == 5.0 (integer vs. float)
> - '5' == 5 (string vs. integer)
> - True == 1 (boolean vs. integer)
> - False == 0 (boolean vs. integer)
>
> Which ones return True? Which return False? Why does Python compare some types differently?"

**Expected Outcome**: You'll discover that Python compares values (5 and 5.0 are the same value, different types); learn that bool has special relationships with int (True==1, False==0); understand type coercion in comparisons.

---

### Prompt 4: Synthesis & Validation (Understand + Analyze)

Copy and ask your AI:

> "I see how comparisons work, but why are they in Chapter 15 BEFORE Chapter 17 (Control Flow)?
>
> - What is the connection between comparisons and if statements?
> - Why do I need to understand == before learning if x == y: ?
> - How does Chapter 15 prepare me for Chapter 17?
>
> Show me an example if statement that uses comparison operators, and explain the connection."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand that comparisons are foundational (standalone True/False values) before they're used in if statements; see how Chapter 15 (operators producing True/False) prepares for Chapter 17 (using True/False in decisions); appreciate the learning progression from understanding operators to using them in control structures.

---

**Safety Note**: AI-generated code may contain errors. Always run it, check the results, and ask "Why is this True?" or "Why is this False?" when results surprise you. Comparisons are deterministic—once you understand the logic, you'll predict results accurately.
