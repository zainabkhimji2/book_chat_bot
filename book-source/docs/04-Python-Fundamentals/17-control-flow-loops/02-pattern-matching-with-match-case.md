# Pattern Matching with match-case

You just learned how to make decisions using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. They work great! But sometimes you find yourself writing long chains of `elif` statements that all check the same variable against different values. When that happens, there's a clearer way to express your intent: Python's `match-case` syntax.

Think of `match-case` as a structured decision table. Instead of reading through a chain of conditions one by one, you can see all possible values and their outcomes at a glance. This lesson introduces you to pattern matching—a modern Python feature (added in Python 3.10) that makes certain types of decisions easier to read and maintain.

**What You'll Learn:**
- When `match-case` improves code readability over `if/elif/else`
- How to write basic `match-case` statements
- How to match specific values (literal patterns)
- How to handle "everything else" cases with the wildcard pattern `_`
- How to ask your AI companion to convert between styles

**Prerequisites:** Lesson 1 (Making Decisions with Conditionals)
**CEFR Level:** A2-B1 (Transitional)
**Time:** 50-65 minutes

## Why match-case Exists: Readability Matters

Let's say you're building a program that responds to HTTP status codes. Here's how you might write it with `if/elif/else`:

```python
# Using if/elif/else to handle HTTP status codes
status_code: int = 404

if status_code == 200:
    print("OK - Request succeeded")
elif status_code == 404:
    print("Not Found - Resource doesn't exist")
elif status_code == 500:
    print("Internal Server Error - Something went wrong")
elif status_code == 403:
    print("Forbidden - Access denied")
else:
    print("Unknown status code")
```

This works perfectly, but notice the pattern: you're checking the **same variable** (`status_code`) against **different values** over and over. The intent is clear once you read it, but the structure is repetitive.

Now look at the same logic using `match-case`:

```python
# Using match-case for the same logic
status_code: int = 404

match status_code:
    case 200:
        print("OK - Request succeeded")
    case 404:
        print("Not Found - Resource doesn't exist")
    case 500:
        print("Internal Server Error - Something went wrong")
    case 403:
        print("Forbidden - Access denied")
    case _:
        print("Unknown status code")
```

**What's different?**
- You only mention `status_code` **once** (in the `match` line)
- Each `case` shows a value, not a comparison
- The structure looks like a table of possibilities
- The wildcard `_` (underscore) handles "everything else"

**When does this improve your code?** When you're comparing one variable against multiple specific values. The `match-case` structure makes your intent crystal clear: "Here are all the possibilities for this value."

## 🎓 Tier 1: Book Teaches - Basic match-case Syntax

### The match-case Structure

Here's the pattern you'll use:

```python
match <variable_to_check>:
    case <value1>:
        # Code to run if variable equals value1
    case <value2>:
        # Code to run if variable equals value2
    case _:
        # Code to run if no other case matched (default)
```

**Key points:**
- `match` starts the decision structure (like the first `if`)
- Each `case` represents one possible value
- The colon (`:`) is required after `match` and each `case`
- Indentation matters (just like with `if` statements)
- The underscore `_` is the wildcard pattern—it matches anything

**IMPORTANT:** `match-case` was added in Python 3.10 (October 2021). If you're using Python 3.9 or earlier, this syntax won't work. You'll see a `SyntaxError`. Your code will run fine on Python 3.14+ (the version we're using).

---

### Example 1: HTTP Status Codes (Literal Patterns)

Let's see the complete example in action:

```python
# match-case with HTTP status codes
status_code: int = 200  # Try changing this to 404, 500, 403, or 999

match status_code:
    case 200:
        message: str = "OK - Request succeeded"
    case 404:
        message: str = "Not Found - Resource doesn't exist"
    case 500:
        message: str = "Internal Server Error - Something went wrong"
    case 403:
        message: str = "Forbidden - Access denied"
    case _:
        message: str = "Unknown status code"

print(message)
```

**Expected output (with status_code=200):**
```
OK - Request succeeded
```

**Expected output (with status_code=999):**
```
Unknown status code
```

**How this executes:**
1. Python looks at the value of `status_code`
2. It checks each `case` from top to bottom
3. When it finds a match, it runs that code block
4. It **stops checking** after the first match (no fall-through)
5. If no case matches, it runs the `_` wildcard case

**Note:** Unlike `if/elif/else`, you don't need `break` statements. Python automatically stops after the first matching case.

### Example 2: Menu Selection (Wildcard Pattern in Action)

Let's build a simple menu system:

```python
# Menu selection with match-case
choice: str = "save"  # Try: "save", "load", "quit", "help", "unknown"

match choice:
    case "save":
        print("Saving your work...")
    case "load":
        print("Loading saved data...")
    case "quit":
        print("Exiting program. Goodbye!")
    case "help":
        print("Available commands: save, load, quit, help")
    case _:
        print(f"Unknown command: '{choice}'. Type 'help' for options.")

# Example output with choice="save": Saving your work...
# Example output with choice="unknown": Unknown command: 'unknown'. Type 'help' for options.
```

**Why use the wildcard `_`?**
Users might type anything—`"sav"` (typo), `"exit"` (synonym), or `"123"` (random input). The wildcard pattern catches all unexpected inputs and gives helpful feedback. Without it, your program would just do nothing when users enter invalid commands.

**Comparison to if/elif:**
```python
# Same logic with if/elif/else
if choice == "save":
    print("Saving your work...")
elif choice == "load":
    print("Loading saved data...")
elif choice == "quit":
    print("Exiting program. Goodbye!")
elif choice == "help":
    print("Available commands: save, load, quit, help")
else:
    print(f"Unknown command: '{choice}'. Type 'help' for options.")
```

Both work. The `match-case` version makes the intent clearer: "Here's a menu of options." The `if/elif` version emphasizes the sequential checking: "Is it this? Or this? Or this?"

## 🚀 Tier 2: AI Companion - Converting and Extending Patterns

### Example 3: Converting if/elif to match-case (Traffic Light Logic)

You learned about traffic lights in Lesson 1. Let's ask your AI companion to convert that logic to `match-case`.

**💬 AI CoLearning Prompt:**

"I have this if/elif/else logic for traffic light colors:

```python
color: str = "yellow"

if color == "red":
    action: str = "Stop"
elif color == "yellow":
    action: str = "Slow down"
elif color == "green":
    action: str = "Go"
else:
    action: str = "Unknown signal"

print(action)
```

Convert this to match-case syntax. Keep the type hints and comments."

**🤖 AI-Generated Code:**

```python
# Traffic light logic with match-case
color: str = "yellow"

match color:
    case "red":
        action: str = "Stop"
    case "yellow":
        action: str = "Slow down"
    case "green":
        action: str = "Go"
    case _:
        action: str = "Unknown signal"

print(action)

# Expected output: Slow down
```

**✨ Teaching Tip:** Notice how the AI preserved your intent while changing the structure. This is a great use case for your AI companion—mechanical conversions between equivalent patterns. You specify what you want ("convert to match-case"), and the AI handles the syntax details.

**When you validate AI-generated code:**
- Does it produce the same output for the same inputs? (Test with `color="red"`, `color="green"`, `color="yellow"`, `color="blue"`)
- Are the type hints still present? ✅
- Is the wildcard case `_` at the end? ✅

### Example 4: Multiple match-case Statements (Calculator Operations)

Let's build a simple calculator that handles basic operations:

**💬 AI CoLearning Prompt:**

"Create a match-case that takes an operation ('+', '-', '*', '/') and two numbers (10 and 5), then performs the calculation. Include type hints and handle unknown operations with the wildcard pattern."

**🤖 AI-Generated Code:**

```python
# Simple calculator with match-case
operation: str = "+"
num1: int = 10
num2: int = 5
result: int | float | str  # Result can be int, float, or error message

match operation:
    case "+":
        result = num1 + num2
    case "-":
        result = num1 - num2
    case "*":
        result = num1 * num2
    case "/":
        if num2 != 0:
            result = num1 / num2
        else:
            result = "Error: Division by zero"
    case _:
        result = f"Unknown operation: {operation}"

print(f"{num1} {operation} {num2} = {result}")

# Example outputs:
# With operation="+": 10 + 5 = 15
# With operation="/": 10 / 5 = 2.0
# With operation="%": 10 % 5 = Unknown operation: %
```

**🎓 Instructor Commentary:**
Notice that `case "/"` includes extra logic (checking for division by zero). You can have multiple lines of code in each case block—just keep them indented. Also notice the type hint `int | float | str` on `result`—this is a **union type** that says "result can be an integer, a float, or a string." Modern Python lets you express this clearly.

**Your job when reviewing this code:**
- Test all four operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Test the division by zero case (change `num2` to `0`)
- Test an unknown operation (change `operation` to `"%"`)

## ⚠️ Red Flags: Common match-case Mistakes

Watch out for these common errors when writing `match-case` statements:

### 1. Using Python 3.9 or Earlier

**Error you'll see:**
```
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

**Why:** `match-case` was added in Python 3.10 (October 2021). If you're using an older version, Python doesn't recognize the syntax.

**Fix:** Check your Python version:
```bash
python --version
```
If it shows Python 3.9.x or earlier, you need to use `if/elif/else` instead, or upgrade Python.

**💬 Ask Your AI:**
"I'm getting a SyntaxError with match-case. I'm using Python 3.9. Can you rewrite this using if/elif/else instead?"

---

### 2. Missing Colon After case

**❌ Wrong:**
```python
match status_code
    case 200
        print("OK")
```

**✅ Correct:**
```python
match status_code:
    case 200:
        print("OK")
```

**Error you'll see:** `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`
**Fix:** Add colons after `match <variable>` and after each `case <value>`.

---

### 3. Unreachable Patterns (Wildcard in the Middle)

**❌ Wrong:**
```python
match status_code:
    case 200:
        print("OK")
    case _:
        print("Unknown")
    case 404:  # This will NEVER run!
        print("Not Found")
```

**Why this fails:** Once Python matches the wildcard `_`, it stops checking. The `case 404` below it becomes unreachable—it can never execute.

**✅ Correct:** Always put the wildcard `_` **last**:
```python
match status_code:
    case 200:
        print("OK")
    case 404:
        print("Not Found")
    case _:
        print("Unknown")
```

**💬 Ask Your AI:**
"Why does my match-case always print 'Unknown' even when I pass 404? Here's my code: [paste code]"

---

### 4. Type Mismatches

**❌ Wrong:**
```python
status_code: int = 200

match status_code:
    case "200":  # This is a string, not an integer!
        print("OK")
```

**Why this fails:** You're comparing an `int` (200) to a `str` ("200"). They're not equal, so the case won't match.

**✅ Correct:** Match the types:
```python
status_code: int = 200

match status_code:
    case 200:  # Integer matches integer
        print("OK")
```

**💬 Ask Your AI:**
"My match-case isn't matching status_code=200. The case uses '200' (string). What's wrong?"

---

### 5. Missing Default Case

**⚠️ Not an error, but risky:**
```python
match choice:
    case "save":
        print("Saving...")
    case "load":
        print("Loading...")
# What happens if choice = "help"? Nothing!
```

**Why this is risky:** If none of the cases match, your program does nothing. This can confuse users (or you, when debugging).

**✅ Better:** Always include a default case:
```python
match choice:
    case "save":
        print("Saving...")
    case "load":
        print("Loading...")
    case _:
        print(f"Unknown command: {choice}")
```

**When you can skip `case _`:** Only when you've covered **all possible values**. For example, if you're matching `True` or `False` (a boolean), you only need two cases.

## Try With AI

Time to practice pattern matching with your AI companion! Work through these four prompts in order.

**Tool Selection:** Since we're in Part 4, and AI companion tools were introduced in Parts 1-3, use **your AI companion tool** (ChatGPT web, Claude CLI, Gemini CLI, or whichever you've set up). If you're using a CLI tool, the prompts below will work as-is. If you're using a web interface, just paste the prompt text.

---

### 1. Recall: Wildcard Pattern Purpose

**Prompt:**
```
What's the purpose of the wildcard pattern _ in match-case? When should you use it?
```

**Expected Outcome:**
Your AI should explain that `_` matches any value that didn't match previous cases. It's like the `else` clause in `if/elif/else`. You should use it to handle unexpected inputs or provide a default action.

**Why this matters:** Understanding the wildcard helps you write defensive code that handles edge cases gracefully.

---

### 2. Understand: Trace Execution

**Prompt:**
```
Explain how this match-case evaluates when color='yellow':

```python
color: str = "yellow"

match color:
    case "red":
        action = "Stop"
    case "yellow":
        action = "Slow down"
    case "green":
        action = "Go"
    case _:
        action = "Unknown signal"
```

Walk me through step-by-step.
```

**Expected Outcome:**
Your AI should trace the execution:
1. Python sees `match color` and looks at the value: `"yellow"`
2. Checks `case "red"`: no match, continues
3. Checks `case "yellow"`: **match found!** Runs `action = "Slow down"`
4. Stops checking (doesn't evaluate `case "green"` or `case _`)
5. Final value of `action` is `"Slow down"`

**Why this matters:** Tracing execution helps you understand control flow and predict outputs.

---

### 3. Apply: Generate Code

**Prompt:**
```
Generate a match-case for days of the week. It should:
- Take an integer (1-7) representing the day
- Case 1 → "Monday"
- Case 2 → "Tuesday"
- ... (continue through Sunday)
- Include type hints
- Include a default case for invalid numbers (like 0 or 8)

Show the complete code with an example where day_number = 3.
```

**Expected Outcome:**
Your AI should generate code like this:

```python
day_number: int = 3

match day_number:
    case 1:
        day_name: str = "Monday"
    case 2:
        day_name: str = "Tuesday"
    case 3:
        day_name: str = "Wednesday"
    case 4:
        day_name: str = "Thursday"
    case 5:
        day_name: str = "Friday"
    case 6:
        day_name: str = "Saturday"
    case 7:
        day_name: str = "Sunday"
    case _:
        day_name: str = "Invalid day number"

print(f"Day {day_number} is {day_name}")
# Output: Day 3 is Wednesday
```

**Your validation steps:**
- Run the code with `day_number = 3` → Should print "Wednesday" ✅
- Change to `day_number = 7` → Should print "Sunday" ✅
- Change to `day_number = 0` → Should print "Invalid day number" ✅
- Check that type hints are present ✅

**Why this matters:** Practicing code generation helps you communicate intent clearly to AI.

---

### 4. Evaluate: Readability Comparison

**Prompt:**
```
Compare the readability of this if/elif chain vs. a match-case equivalent:

```python
# Version A: if/elif
grade: int = 85

if grade >= 90:
    letter = "A"
elif grade >= 80:
    letter = "B"
elif grade >= 70:
    letter = "C"
elif grade >= 60:
    letter = "D"
else:
    letter = "F"
```

When is if/elif better than match-case? When is match-case better than if/elif?
```

**Expected Outcome:**
Your AI should explain:

**When if/elif is better:**
- For **range comparisons** (`>=`, `<`, etc.)
- For **complex conditions** combining multiple variables (`if age > 18 and has_license`)
- When you need to evaluate **different variables** in each branch

**When match-case is better:**
- For **exact value matching** (comparing one variable against multiple specific values)
- When you have a **fixed set of options** (like menu choices, status codes, enums)
- When **readability as a table** helps understanding

**For this specific example (grade ranges):** `if/elif` is better because you're comparing ranges (`>= 90`), not exact values. `match-case` works with specific values like `200`, `404`, `"red"`, not ranges.

**Why this matters:** Choosing the right control structure makes your code easier to read and maintain. This is a critical judgment skill for professional development.

---

**🎓 Safety Note:** When AI generates code with `match-case`, always verify:
1. You're using Python 3.10+ (check `python --version`)
2. Type hints match between the variable and case values (int vs int, str vs str)
3. The wildcard `_` is at the **end**, not in the middle
4. Test all cases, including the default

**Next Self-Directed Variation:** Try asking your AI to convert one of your `if/elif/else` chains from Lesson 1 into `match-case` syntax. Then evaluate: did it improve readability? Why or why not?
