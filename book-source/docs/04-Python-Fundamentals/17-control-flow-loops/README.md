# Chapter 17: Control Flow and Loops

Welcome to Chapter 17! In this chapter, you'll learn how to make your Python programs intelligent and efficient by teaching them to make decisions and repeat actions automatically.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Make decisions in code** using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- **Use pattern matching** with Python's modern `match-case` syntax
- **Automate repetition** using `for` and `while` loops
- **Control loop behavior** with `break`, `continue`, and loop-else patterns
- **Combine decisions and loops** to solve complex problems
- **Describe your intent clearly** so AI can help you write correct control flow logic
- **Validate your logic** by testing edge cases and understanding execution flow
