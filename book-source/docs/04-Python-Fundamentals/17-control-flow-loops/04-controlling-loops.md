# Controlling Loops

Sometimes you need more control over how loops execute. You might want to **exit a loop early** when you find what you're searching for, **skip certain iterations** that don't meet your criteria, or **detect whether a loop completed naturally** or was interrupted. Python provides three powerful tools for this: `break`, `continue`, and the loop-`else` clause.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to control loop execution with precision, making your code more efficient and expressive.

## Why Loop Control Matters

Consider these real-world scenarios where basic loops aren't enough:

**Search and Stop**: You're searching a list of 10,000 items for a specific value. Once you find it, there's no point continuing through the remaining items. You need to **exit early**.

**Skip Invalid Data**: You're processing user records, but some have missing or invalid fields. Instead of crashing or processing bad data, you want to **skip those records** and continue with the rest.

**Retry with Limit**: You're asking a user for input and they keep entering invalid data. You want to give them 3 chances, then give up. You need to know whether they **succeeded within the limit** or **ran out of attempts**.

These scenarios require more than simple `for` and `while` loops—they need **loop control statements**.

## Breaking Out Early: The `break` Statement

The `break` statement **immediately exits the loop**, skipping any remaining iterations. It's like saying "I found what I was looking for—stop searching."

### Basic Break: Search for a Number

```python
# Search for a target number in a list
numbers: list[int] = [3, 7, 12, 5, 19, 8]
target: int = 12

for num in numbers:
    if num == target:
        print(f"Found {target}!")
        break  # Exit the loop immediately
    print(f"Checking {num}...")

# Output:
# Checking 3...
# Checking 7...
# Found 12!
```

**What happens**:
1. Loop starts, checks 3 (not the target)
2. Checks 7 (not the target)
3. Checks 12 (matches!) → prints "Found 12!" → `break` exits the loop
4. Numbers 5, 19, 8 are **never checked** because the loop exited early

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt
> "Why does `break` immediately exit the loop instead of just ending the current iteration? What's happening in memory?"

### When to Use Break

Use `break` when:
- ✅ Searching for a specific item (stop when found)
- ✅ Validating input with a retry limit (stop when valid)
- ✅ Processing until a termination condition is met
- ❌ You need to skip ONE iteration but continue the loop (use `continue` instead)

#### 🎓 Instructor Commentary
> In AI-native development, you don't memorize every use case for `break`—you understand the **early exit pattern**: "I got what I needed; no point continuing." When you recognize that pattern in your logic, `break` is your tool.

## Skipping Iterations: The `continue` Statement

The `continue` statement **skips the rest of the current iteration** and moves to the next one. It's like saying "This one doesn't count—move to the next."

### Basic Continue: Skip Even Numbers

```python
# Print only odd numbers from 1 to 10
for num in range(1, 11):
    if num % 2 == 0:  # If the number is even
        continue      # Skip to next iteration
    print(f"{num} is odd")

# Output:
# 1 is odd
# 3 is odd
# 5 is odd
# 7 is odd
# 9 is odd
```

**What happens**:
1. When `num = 2` (even), `continue` skips the `print` and jumps to `num = 3`
2. When `num = 3` (odd), condition is False → `print` executes
3. Pattern repeats for all numbers

**Difference from Break**:
- `break` → Exit the **entire loop**
- `continue` → Skip the **current iteration** only

#### 🚀 CoLearning Challenge

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Generate a for loop that prints numbers 1-20, but skips multiples of 3. Then explain how `continue` works differently from `break` with a diagram."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand when to skip iterations vs when to exit entirely.

### Real-World Continue: Filtering Invalid Data

```python
# Process user records, skip invalid ones
user_records: list[dict[str, str]] = [
    {"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"},
    {"name": "Bob", "email": ""},  # Invalid: missing email
    {"name": "Charlie", "email": "charlie@example.com"},
    {"name": "", "email": "dave@example.com"},  # Invalid: missing name
]

for record in user_records:
    # Skip records with missing data
    if not record["name"] or not record["email"]:
        print(f"Skipping invalid record: {record}")
        continue

    # Process valid records
    print(f"Processing {record['name']} ({record['email']})")

# Output:
# Processing Alice (alice@example.com)
# Skipping invalid record: {'name': 'Bob', 'email': ''}
# Processing Charlie (charlie@example.com)
# Skipping invalid record: {'name': '', 'email': 'dave@example.com'}
```

This pattern is common in **data validation**: check for problems, skip bad data, process good data.

#### ✨ Teaching Tip
> Use your AI as code reviewer: Paste a loop with complex if-else logic and ask "Could I simplify this with `continue` instead of nesting?" You'll learn when early returns make code clearer.

## Detecting Completion: The `for...else` Pattern

Python's loops have an **else clause** that executes **only if the loop completes normally** (without hitting `break`). This is one of Python's most misunderstood but powerful features.

### For...Else: Search with "Not Found" Detection

```python
# Search for a name in a list
names: list[str] = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"]
search_name: str = "Eve"

for name in names:
    if name == search_name:
        print(f"Found {search_name}!")
        break
else:
    # This runs ONLY if break was never called
    print(f"{search_name} not found in the list")

# Output:
# Eve not found in the list
```

**How it works**:
- If `break` is called → `else` is **skipped**
- If loop completes naturally → `else` **executes**

**Try it with a name that exists**:

```python
search_name: str = "Charlie"

for name in names:
    if name == search_name:
        print(f"Found {search_name}!")
        break
else:
    print(f"{search_name} not found in the list")

# Output:
# Found Charlie!
# (else clause skipped because break was called)
```

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt
> "Why is the loop-else pattern called 'else' if it's really 'if loop completed without break'? Explain the naming reasoning and show alternatives without using else."

### Common Mistake: Misunderstanding When Else Runs

**❌ WRONG ASSUMPTION**: "Else runs if the loop has no items"

```python
# Empty list
empty_list: list[int] = []

for item in empty_list:
    print(item)
else:
    print("This runs because the loop completed (even though it had 0 iterations)")

# Output:
# This runs because the loop completed (even though it had 0 iterations)
```

**✅ CORRECT UNDERSTANDING**: Else runs when the loop **completes naturally**, whether it had 0 iterations or 1,000.

The **only** way to prevent the `else` clause from running is with `break`.

### Why Use For...Else?

**Without `for...else`** (using a flag variable):

```python
found: bool = False

for name in names:
    if name == search_name:
        print(f"Found {search_name}!")
        found = True
        break

if not found:
    print(f"{search_name} not found")
```

**With `for...else`** (cleaner):

```python
for name in names:
    if name == search_name:
        print(f"Found {search_name}!")
        break
else:
    print(f"{search_name} not found")
```

The `for...else` version is **shorter and more readable**—no need for a flag variable.

#### 🎓 Instructor Commentary
> In AI-native development, the loop-else pattern is rare but powerful. You don't memorize when to use it—you recognize the "search with failure case" scenario. When you need to know "Did I find it or exhaust all options?", loop-else is your answer.

## While...Else: Retry with Limit

The `while...else` pattern works the same way: **else runs if the loop exits normally** (not via `break`).

This is perfect for **retry scenarios** where you want to know if the user succeeded or ran out of attempts.

### Retry Input with Limit

```python
# Give user 3 chances to enter a positive number
max_attempts: int = 3
attempt: int = 0

while attempt < max_attempts:
    user_input: str = input("Enter a positive number: ")

    # Check if input is a valid number using string methods
    if user_input.isdigit():  # Returns True for positive integers
        number: int = int(user_input)
        if number > 0:
            print(f"Success! You entered {number}")
            break  # Exit loop on success
        else:
            print("That's not positive. Try again.")
    else:
        print("That's not a valid number. Try again.")

    attempt += 1
else:
    # This runs ONLY if we exhausted all attempts without break
    print("Sorry, you've run out of attempts.")
```

**Execution scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: User succeeds on attempt 2**
```
Enter a positive number: abc
That's not a valid number. Try again.
Enter a positive number: -5
That's not positive. Try again.
Enter a positive number: 10
Success! You entered 10
(else clause skipped because break was called)
```

**Scenario 2: User fails all 3 attempts**
```
Enter a positive number: abc
That's not a valid number. Try again.
Enter a positive number: -5
That's not positive. Try again.
Enter a positive number: 0
That's not positive. Try again.
Sorry, you've run out of attempts.
(else clause runs because loop completed without break)
```

### Why While...Else?

**Without `while...else`**:
```python
success: bool = False

while attempt < max_attempts:
    # ... validation logic ...
    if valid:
        success = True
        break
    attempt += 1

if not success:
    print("Sorry, you've run out of attempts.")
```

**With `while...else`**:
```python
while attempt < max_attempts:
    # ... validation logic ...
    if valid:
        break
    attempt += 1
else:
    print("Sorry, you've run out of attempts.")
```

Again, the `while...else` version eliminates the need for a flag variable.

## AI Companion: Complex Loop Control Scenarios

Now that you understand the basics, let's explore more complex patterns with your AI companion.

### Combined Break and Continue: Input Validation Loop

Ask your AI to generate this scenario:

#### 🎓 Note: You Might See try-except in AI Responses

When you ask your AI to validate user input, it might generate code using `try` and `except` keywords. This is **exception handling**—a powerful Python feature you'll learn in **Chapter 21**. For now:

- **Don't worry if you see it**: Your AI is showing you professional Python code
- **You don't need to memorize it yet**: Focus on the loop control (`break`, `continue`, `while...else`)
- **Ask for an alternative**: If you see `try-except`, ask your AI: *"Can you show me a version using `.isdigit()` and `.startswith()` instead of try-except? I haven't learned exception handling yet."*

The key learning here is **how `break` and `continue` work together**, not exception handling.

#### 🚀 CoLearning Challenge

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Generate a while loop that asks users to enter numbers. Use `continue` to skip negative numbers (with a warning). Use `break` to exit when they enter 0. Calculate the sum of positive numbers only. Use `.isdigit()` for validation (not try-except). Then explain the flow with a step-by-step trace."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand how `break` and `continue` work together in the same loop.

**Sample AI-generated solution**:

```python
# Sum positive numbers until user enters 0
total: int = 0

while True:  # Infinite loop—relies on break to exit
    user_input: str = input("Enter a number (0 to quit): ")

    # Check if input is a valid number (handles positive, negative, and zero)
    # Note: isdigit() only works for positive integers, so we check for "-" prefix
    is_valid_number: bool = user_input.isdigit() or (
        user_input.startswith("-") and user_input[1:].isdigit()
    )

    if not is_valid_number:
        print("Invalid input. Try again.")
        continue  # Skip this iteration

    number: int = int(user_input)

    if number == 0:
        print(f"Total sum: {total}")
        break  # Exit the loop

    if number < 0:
        print("Negative numbers are ignored.")
        continue  # Skip adding to total

    # Only positive numbers reach here
    total += number
    print(f"Added {number}. Running total: {total}")
```

**Trace execution**:
```
Input: "5" → Valid, positive → total = 5
Input: "-3" → Valid, negative → skip (continue), total = 5
Input: "abc" → Invalid → skip (continue), total = 5
Input: "10" → Valid, positive → total = 15
Input: "0" → Valid, zero → print total (15), break
```

#### ✨ Teaching Tip
> When combining `break` and `continue`, ask your AI: "Trace this loop with inputs [5, -3, 'abc', 10, 0]. Show me which line executes for each input." Seeing the step-by-step flow helps you internalize control flow logic.

## Red Flags: Common Loop Control Mistakes

### 🚩 Red Flag 1: Misunderstanding When Else Executes

**❌ WRONG**:
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
else:
    print("This runs because loop finished")  # Correct behavior

# Student thinks: "Else runs if condition is False"
# Reality: "Else runs if loop completes without break"
```

**✅ AI Troubleshooting Prompt**:
> "I thought loop-else was like if-else, but it's not. Explain the difference and show when else does NOT run in a for loop."

---

### 🚩 Red Flag 2: Using Continue Outside a Loop

**❌ ERROR**:
```python
numbers: list[int] = [1, 2, 3]

if 2 in numbers:
    continue  # SyntaxError: 'continue' not properly in loop
```

**Error Message**:
```
SyntaxError: 'continue' not properly in loop
```

**✅ Fix**: `continue` only works **inside** `for` or `while` loops.

**✅ AI Troubleshooting Prompt**:
> "I'm getting 'SyntaxError: continue not properly in loop'. Why can't I use continue in an if statement? Show me the correct pattern."

---

### 🚩 Red Flag 3: Break After Print (Unreachable Code)

**❌ LOGICAL ERROR**:
```python
for i in range(10):
    break  # Exits immediately on first iteration
    print(i)  # This NEVER runs
```

**✅ Fix**: Put `break` **after** the code you want to execute on the final iteration.

**✅ Correct Pattern**:
```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
    if i == 5:
        break  # Exit after printing 5
```

**✅ AI Troubleshooting Prompt**:
> "My loop with `break` prints nothing. Help me trace the execution and find where break should be placed."

---

### 🚩 Red Flag 4: Overusing Break (When Functions Are Better)

**❌ UNCLEAR CODE**:
```python
for i in range(100):
    for j in range(100):
        if some_condition:
            break  # Which loop does this exit?
```

**✅ CLEARER with Functions** (coming in Chapter 18):
```python
def find_pair(limit: int) -> tuple[int, int] | None:
    for i in range(limit):
        for j in range(limit):
            if some_condition:
                return (i, j)  # Exit entire function
    return None
```

**Note**: You'll learn about functions in the next chapter. For now, know that deeply nested loops with multiple `break` statements often signal that code should be refactored into separate functions.

---

### 🚩 Red Flag 5: Break in Nested Loops Only Exits Inner Loop

**❌ COMMON MISTAKE**:
```python
# Trying to exit both loops at once
for i in range(5):
    for j in range(5):
        if i == 2 and j == 3:
            break  # Only exits the INNER loop (j loop)
    # Outer loop (i loop) continues
```

**Output**:
```
# Processes i=0 with all j values
# Processes i=1 with all j values
# Processes i=2, exits inner loop at j=3, but continues i=3, i=4
```

**✅ AI Troubleshooting Prompt**:
> "I want to exit both nested loops at once, but `break` only exits the inner loop. What are my options? Explain flag variables vs functions vs other patterns."

**✅ Temporary Fix (Using a Flag)**:
```python
found: bool = False

for i in range(5):
    for j in range(5):
        if i == 2 and j == 3:
            found = True
            break  # Exit inner loop
    if found:
        break  # Exit outer loop
```

(Better solutions involve functions with `return`, which you'll learn in Chapter 18.)

## Try With AI

Now that you understand loop control statements, reinforce your learning by working with your AI companion. Use **ChatGPT web** (if you haven't set up an AI tool yet) or **your preferred AI companion** (Gemini CLI, Claude CLI, etc.).

### 1. Recall: Break vs Continue

**Prompt**:
> "What's the difference between `break` and `continue` in Python loops? Give me a simple example showing both in the same loop."

**Expected Outcome**: Your AI will explain that `break` exits the entire loop while `continue` skips the current iteration and moves to the next. You should see a code example demonstrating both.

---

### 2. Understand: Trace For...Else Execution

**Prompt**:
> "Trace this code step-by-step and tell me whether the `else` clause runs:
>
> ```python
> numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
> for num in numbers:
>     if num == 5:
>         print('Found 5!')
>         break
> else:
>     print('5 not found')
> ```
>
> Explain WHY the else clause does or doesn't run."

**Expected Outcome**: Your AI will trace each iteration, show that 5 is never found, `break` is never called, and therefore the `else` clause executes, printing "5 not found".

---

### 3. Apply: Retry Logic with While...Else

**Prompt**:
> "Generate a `while` loop that asks a user to guess a secret number (7). Give them 3 attempts. If they guess correctly, use `break` and print 'Correct!'. If they run out of attempts, use the `else` clause to print 'Out of attempts, the answer was 7'. Include type hints and input validation."

**Expected Outcome**: Your AI will generate code similar to the retry pattern you learned earlier. Test it by entering wrong guesses (e.g., 5, 3, 9) to trigger the `else` clause, then try again with a correct guess to trigger the `break`.

---

### 4. Evaluate: For...Else vs Flag Variable

**Prompt**:
> "Compare these two approaches for searching a list:
>
> **Approach 1 (flag variable)**:
> ```python
> found = False
> for item in items:
>     if item == target:
>         found = True
>         break
> if not found:
>     print('Not found')
> ```
>
> **Approach 2 (for...else)**:
> ```python
> for item in items:
>     if item == target:
>         break
> else:
>     print('Not found')
> ```
>
> When is for...else more elegant? When might a flag variable be clearer? Give me an example where each is better."

**Expected Outcome**: Your AI will explain that `for...else` is more concise for simple search patterns, but flag variables can be clearer when you need to check the result in multiple places or when the logic is complex. You'll gain intuition for when to use each pattern.

---

**Safety & Ethics Note**: Loop control statements can create infinite loops or skip critical validation logic if used incorrectly. Always trace your loop logic manually or with your AI before deploying code that controls retries, validation, or search operations. Ask your AI to review your loop control flow for potential bugs.
