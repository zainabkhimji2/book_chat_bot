# Chapter 24: Object-Oriented Programming - Part 1

## Overview

This chapter introduces **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, a fundamental paradigm for organizing code around objects that bundle data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together. You'll learn why OOP matters for building scalable, maintainable applications—especially in AI-native development where agents themselves are objects with state and capabilities.

Starting from the limitations of procedural programming, you'll discover how OOP solves real-world problems through the **four pillars**: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. Through practical examples ranging from bank accounts to AI agents, you'll build a solid foundation in class design, object creation, and method implementation.

The chapter culminates in a **Game Character Capstone Project** where you'll design and implement a multi-class system, integrating all the concepts learned into a cohesive, working application.

### What You'll Build

- Bank account management system demonstrating OOP fundamentals
- AI agent models showing objects with state and behavior
- Multi-class game character system with combat mechanics and inventory management

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

### 1. Understand OOP Fundamentals
- **Explain** what Object-Oriented Programming is and how it differs from procedural programming
- **Identify** the four pillars of OOP (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism) in code examples
- **Analyze** when to use OOP vs procedural approaches for different problem types
- **Evaluate** why OOP matters for modularity, reusability, maintainability, and scalability in professional development

### 2. Create Classes and Objects
- **Write** Python class definitions with proper naming conventions (PascalCase) and docstrings
- **Implement** constructors (`__init__`) that initialize attributes with type hints
- **Create** multiple objects from a single class and verify they maintain independent state
- **Explain** the role of `self` in instance methods and why Python requires it explicitly

### 3. Work with Attributes and Methods
- **Define** instance attributes and methods with appropriate access modifiers
- **Use** type hints for constructor parameters, attributes, and method returns
- **Implement** different method types (instance methods, class methods, static methods)
- **Apply** encapsulation principles to protect data and control access

### 4. Design Multi-Class Systems
- **Design** interactions between multiple classes with clear responsibilities and data flow
- **Model** object relationships (composition, association) in class architecture
- **Organize** multi-class projects with proper module structure
- **Integrate** OOP patterns (encapsulation, properties, methods) into cohesive systems

### 5. Apply OOP to AI-Native Development
- **Connect** OOP principles to AI agent-based systems (agents as objects with state and behavior)
- **Describe** how modern AI frameworks use classes to represent models, agents, and tools
- **Collaborate** with AI to design class structures and validate generated code
- **Plan** projects by describing architecture to AI and refining design iteratively
