# Chapter 18: Lists, Tuples, and Dictionary

This chapter teaches Python's three foundational collection structures: **lists** (mutable sequences), **tuples** (immutable sequences), and **dictionaries** (key-value mappings). You'll learn when to use each structure, how to manipulate them effectively, and how to combine them in real-world applications.

By the end of this chapter, you'll build a complete **Data Processing Pipeline** that ingests CSV data, filters it with comprehensions, aggregates statistics with dictionaries, and outputs formatted reports—demonstrating how all three structures work together in production code.

## What You'll Learn

### Core Concepts (46+ unique concepts across 11 lessons)

**Lists** (Lessons 1-5):
- Creating and accessing lists with type hints
- Indexing, slicing, and length operations
- Mutation methods: `append()`, `extend()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `clear()`
- Sorting and reversing: `sort()` vs `sorted()`, `reverse()` vs `[::-1]`
- List comprehensions with filtering
- Aliasing vs copying

**Tuples** (Lesson 6):
- Immutability as a design guarantee
- Single-element tuple syntax `(1,)`
- Unpacking for multiple assignment
- Using tuples as dict keys (hashable property)
- When to choose tuples over lists

**Dictionaries** (Lessons 7-9):
- Key-value mappings with union types
- CRUD operations: create, read, update, delete
- Safe access with `.get()` and `in` operator
- Iteration: `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.items()`
- Dict comprehensions for transformation
- Accumulator patterns for aggregation

**Architectural Thinking** (Lessons 10-11):
- Decision matrix: When to use which structure
- Performance implications (O(1) vs O(n))
- Mutability vs immutability trade-offs
- Integration patterns in real applications
