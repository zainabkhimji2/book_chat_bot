# Lists Part 3: Sorting, Reversing, and Advanced Methods

You've learned how to create lists and modify them with methods like `append()` and `remove()`. Now you're ready for operations that transform lists in powerful ways: **sorting data, reversing order, and querying contents**. These methods show an important Python pattern that will appear throughout the language—and mastering them now prepares you for professional code.

Here's the challenge you'll solve in this lesson: imagine you have a list of test scores `[85, 92, 78, 95, 88]`. You need to find the highest score, count how many students scored 85, and create a sorted list without modifying the original. How do you do this without writing complicated loops? The methods in this lesson are your answer.

---

## Understanding the Sort Pattern: Methods That Modify vs Functions That Return

Python has two tools for sorting, and they work differently. Let's start there because this pattern appears everywhere in Python.

**The Pattern**: When you want to **change the original list**, use the **method** `.sort()`. When you want to **keep the original and get a new sorted list**, use the **function** `sorted()`.

```python
scores: list[int] = [85, 92, 78, 95, 88]

# Method: Modifies the original list IN-PLACE, returns None
scores.sort()  # scores is now [78, 85, 88, 92, 95]

# Function: Returns a NEW sorted list, leaves original alone
sorted_scores: list[int] = sorted(scores)  # sorted_scores is [78, 85, 88, 92, 95]
# scores is still [78, 85, 88, 92, 95] (sorted_scores is same)
```

Why does Python design it this way? Because the designers wanted to make **intent explicit**. When you see `scores.sort()`, experienced developers immediately know: "This modifies the original." When you see `sorted(scores)`, they know: "This creates a new list." This clarity matters in professional code.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "Why does Python have both `.sort()` and `sorted()`? Explain the difference and when you'd use each. What happens if you write `result = scores.sort()`?"

**Expected outcome**: You'll understand that `.sort()` returns `None`, making `result = scores.sort()` a common mistake.

#### 🎓 Instructor Commentary

> In AI-native development, you don't memorize this distinction—you understand: "I need to preserve the original" or "I'm okay modifying it." Then ask AI: "Which method should I use?" The why matters more than the syntax.

---

## Specification & Code Example: Sort vs Sorted

**Specification**: Compare in-place sorting with functional sorting to understand the design pattern.

**Prompts for AI Exploration**:
```
1. "Show me how .sort() and sorted() differ when I have scores = [85, 92, 78]"
2. "What happens if I write: result = scores.sort()? Why?"
3. "Which is faster: .sort() or sorted()? Why?"
```

**Generated Code** (with validation):

```python
# EX-007: sort() vs sorted()

scores: list[int] = [85, 92, 78, 95, 88]

# Approach 1: Use sorted() to preserve original
sorted_scores: list[int] = sorted(scores)
print(f"Sorted (new list): {sorted_scores}")      # [78, 85, 88, 92, 95]
print(f"Original (unchanged): {scores}")           # [85, 92, 78, 95, 88]

# Approach 2: Use .sort() to modify in-place
scores.sort()
print(f"After .sort(): {scores}")                  # [78, 85, 88, 92, 95]

# Common mistake to avoid:
result = scores.sort()  # This returns None!
print(f"Result of .sort() is: {result}")           # None (oops!)
```

**Validation**:
- ✓ `sorted()` returns a new list, original unchanged
- ✓ `.sort()` modifies original in-place, returns `None`
- ✓ Assigning result of `.sort()` to a variable creates `None` (common error)

---

## Reversing Lists: Two Approaches

Just like sorting, Python offers **two ways to reverse**: a method `.reverse()` and a slice notation `[::-1]`.

**The Method**: `.reverse()` flips the list in-place
```python
numbers: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.reverse()  # numbers is now [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

**The Slice**: `[::-1]` creates a new reversed list
```python
numbers: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reversed_numbers: list[int] = numbers[::-1]  # [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
# numbers is still [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Which should you use?** If you need the original preserved, use `[::-1]`. If you're modifying a list you don't plan to reuse, `.reverse()` is slightly more direct.

#### 🚀 CoLearning Challenge

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Create a function that takes a list of words, reverses the order using both `.reverse()` and `[::-1]`. Show me both approaches and explain which is clearer."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll see that both produce the same result, and readability depends on context.

---

## Finding and Counting: count() and index()

Sometimes you don't need to sort—you need to **ask questions** about the list: "How many times does 85 appear?" and "Where is the value 95?"

```python
scores: list[int] = [85, 92, 78, 85, 95, 88, 85]

# Count occurrences of a value
num_eighties: int = scores.count(85)  # 3 (appears 3 times)

# Find the first position of a value
position: int = scores.index(95)  # 4 (at index 4)
```

**Important**: `index()` returns the **first** occurrence. If the value isn't in the list, it raises a `ValueError`:

```python
scores: list[int] = [85, 92, 78, 95, 88]

# This works fine
position: int = scores.index(85)  # 0

# This crashes if value not found
position = scores.index(100)  # ValueError: 100 is not in list
```

**To avoid the error**, check first or use a loop:

```python
if 100 in scores:
    position = scores.index(100)
else:
    print("Score 100 not found")
```

#### ✨ Teaching Tip

> Use Claude Code to explore edge cases: "What happens if I call `.index()` on an empty list? On a list where the value appears multiple times? Show me the errors and explain them."

---

## Specification & Code Example: count() and index()

**Specification**: Demonstrate querying list contents with count() and index() methods.

**AI Prompts**:
```
1. "Show me how to use .count() and .index() on a list of student names"
2. "What error do I get if I use .index() on a value that doesn't exist?"
3. "How would I find all positions where a value appears (not just the first)?"
```

**Generated Code** (with validation):

```python
# EX-008: Using count() and index()

scores: list[int] = [85, 92, 78, 85, 95, 88, 85, 92]

# Count occurrences
count_85: int = scores.count(85)     # 3
count_92: int = scores.count(92)     # 2
count_100: int = scores.count(100)   # 0 (returns 0 if not found)

print(f"Score 85 appears {count_85} times")  # 3 times
print(f"Score 100 appears {count_100} times")  # 0 times

# Find first position
pos_92: int = scores.index(92)  # 1 (first occurrence at index 1)
print(f"First score of 92 is at index {pos_92}")  # index 1

# Error handling: check before using index()
if 95 in scores:
    position: int = scores.index(95)
    print(f"Score 95 is at index {position}")  # index 4
else:
    print("Score 95 not found")
```

**Validation**:
- ✓ `.count()` returns 0 if value not found (doesn't error)
- ✓ `.index()` raises ValueError if value not found
- ✓ Checking with `in` operator prevents errors before calling `.index()`

## The Critical Lesson: List Aliasing vs Copying

Here's where many beginners make a mistake. When you do `list2 = list1`, you don't create a **copy**—you create an **alias**. Both variables point to the same list in memory.

```python
original: list[str] = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
copy_reference: list[str] = original  # This is an ALIAS, not a copy!

# Modify the list through one variable...
copy_reference.append("date")

# ...and it changes in the other
print(original)  # ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
print(copy_reference)  # ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
```

**Why?** In Python, variables are **references to objects in memory**. When you assign `list2 = list1`, you're copying the reference (the address), not the list itself. Both variables now point to the same list.

**The Solution**: Use `.copy()` to create an independent copy:

```python
original: list[str] = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
independent_copy: list[str] = original.copy()  # TRUE COPY

independent_copy.append("date")

print(original)  # ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] (unchanged)
print(independent_copy)  # ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
```

Now they're truly separate—changes to one don't affect the other.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> "Explain what 'aliasing' means in Python. Why does `list2 = list1` create an alias instead of a copy? Draw a memory diagram if you can."

**Expected outcome**: You'll understand that variables are references, not containers.

---

## Specification & Code Example: Aliasing and Copying

**Specification**: Demonstrate the aliasing problem and the `.copy()` solution.

**AI Prompts**:
```
1. "Show me the difference between list2 = list1 and list2 = list1.copy()"
2. "Modify one list and show how the other is affected (or not)"
3. "How would I detect if two lists are aliases of the same object?"
```

**Generated Code** (with validation):

```python
# EX-009: Aliasing problem and .copy() solution

shopping_cart: list[str] = ["milk", "eggs", "bread"]

# Problem: Aliasing
cart_reference: list[str] = shopping_cart  # ALIAS, not copy
cart_reference.append("butter")
print(f"Original: {shopping_cart}")      # ["milk", "eggs", "bread", "butter"]
print(f"Reference: {cart_reference}")    # ["milk", "eggs", "bread", "butter"]
print("They're the same object!\n")

# Solution: Use .copy()
original_list: list[str] = ["milk", "eggs", "bread"]
independent_copy: list[str] = original_list.copy()  # TRUE COPY
independent_copy.append("butter")

print(f"Original: {original_list}")      # ["milk", "eggs", "bread"]
print(f"Copy: {independent_copy}")       # ["milk", "eggs", "bread", "butter"]
print("Now they're truly separate!")

# Verify they're different objects
print(f"Are they the same object? {original_list is independent_copy}")  # False
```

**Validation**:
- ✓ Aliasing: Both variables point to same list, changes visible through both
- ✓ Copying: `.copy()` creates independent list, changes don't affect original
- ✓ `is` operator confirms whether two variables reference the same object

#### 🎓 Instructor Commentary

> This aliasing concept is crucial before you get to functions (Ch 20). When you pass a list to a function and modify it, you're modifying the original because it's passed by reference, not value. Understand this now, and debugging later becomes much easier.

---

## Pattern Recognition: When to Use Each Method

You now know **seven tools** for transforming lists. Let's summarize when to use each:

| Method/Function | Purpose | Modifies Original? | Use When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.sort()` | Sort in-place | Yes (returns None) | Okay to change original |
| `sorted()` | Sort to new list | No | Need to preserve original |
| `.reverse()` | Reverse in-place | Yes (returns None) | Okay to change original |
| `[::-1]` | Reverse to new list | No | Need to preserve original |
| `.count()` | Count occurrences | No | Finding how many of a value |
| `.index()` | Find first position | No | Finding where value is |
| `.copy()` | Create independent copy | No | Avoid unintended aliasing |

The **pattern** is: methods that modify (`.sort()`, `.reverse()`) return `None`. Functions and safe-copy methods return new objects.

#### 🚀 CoLearning Challenge

Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Given a list of student test scores, write code that: (1) keeps the original unsorted, (2) creates a sorted copy, (3) finds how many students scored above 90, (4) finds the highest score. Use appropriate methods for each task."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll apply multiple methods in realistic sequence and understand when to choose method vs function.

---

## Practice: Putting It All Together

Let's practice these methods with a realistic scenario.

**Exercise 1: The Quiz Scores**

You have quiz scores: `[88, 75, 92, 75, 88, 90]`. Write code that:
1. Creates a sorted list without modifying the original
2. Counts how many students got exactly 88
3. Finds the index of the first score of 92
4. Reverses the original list in-place

Try it yourself first. Then ask AI if you get stuck.

**Exercise 2: The Inventory Copy**

You're tracking a warehouse inventory: `inventory = ["widget_a", "widget_b", "widget_c"]`. Someone passes you the list and says "create a backup before we modify it." You create `backup = inventory`. Then you modify the inventory, and the backup changes too!

What went wrong? How would you fix it to create a true backup?

**Exercise 3: The Aliasing Trap**

Write code that:
1. Creates a list of colors
2. Creates an alias to that list
3. Modifies the alias
4. Shows that the original changed
5. Creates a true copy using `.copy()`
6. Modifies the copy
7. Shows that the original is now safe

---

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

**Mistake 1**: Expecting `.sort()` to return a sorted list

```python
# ❌ WRONG
sorted_scores = scores.sort()  # sorted_scores is None!

# ✅ RIGHT
scores.sort()  # Modify in-place
# OR
sorted_scores = sorted(scores)  # Create new sorted list
```

**Mistake 2**: Using `.index()` without checking if value exists

```python
# ❌ WRONG
position = scores.index(999)  # ValueError if 999 not in list

# ✅ RIGHT
if 999 in scores:
    position = scores.index(999)
else:
    position = -1  # Indicate "not found"
```

**Mistake 3**: Not realizing assignment creates an alias

```python
# ❌ WRONG
backup = scores  # This is an alias!
backup.append(100)  # Original scores changed!

# ✅ RIGHT
backup = scores.copy()  # True independent copy
backup.append(100)  # Original scores safe
```

#### ✨ Teaching Tip

> When you get an error, paste it into Claude Code and ask: "I got [error message]. What does it mean and why did it happen?" This debugging habit will save you hours in your programming career.

---

## Try With AI

Use **Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or ChatGPT** (whichever you're familiar with) to explore these methods and build your intuition.

**Prompt 1: Remember the Methods**

> "List all the methods/functions we learned in this lesson: sort, sorted, reverse, count, index, copy. For each, write one sentence describing what it does and whether it modifies the original."

**Expected outcome**: You'll articulate the purpose and behavior of each method from memory.

---

**Prompt 2: Understand the Pattern**

> "Explain why scores.sort() returns None but sorted(scores) returns a list. Why would Python design these differently?"

**Expected outcome**: You'll grasp the design philosophy: explicit intent through method vs function distinction.

---

**Prompt 3: Apply to Real Data**

> "You have a list of product prices: [45.99, 29.50, 99.99, 45.99, 15.25]. Write code that: (1) shows the original unsorted list, (2) creates a sorted list in ascending order, (3) counts how many items cost exactly $45.99, (4) finds the first position of the $99.99 item. Test your code with the provided prices."

**Expected outcome**: You'll write working code that combines multiple methods in a realistic scenario.

---

**Prompt 4: Analyze Design Decisions**

> "You're designing a student grade management system. You need to: store original grades, create a sorted list for display, and make backups before modifications. For each operation, explain whether you'd use sort(), sorted(), .copy(), or another method and why."

**Expected outcome**: You'll evaluate tradeoffs and justify architectural choices—this is B1-level thinking.

---

**A note on responsible AI use**: When AI generates code for you, read it carefully before running. Ask AI to explain each line. If something looks wrong, ask "Why did you use approach X instead of Y?" This transforms AI from code generator to learning partner. Also, remember that `.sort()` modifying the original list is intentional design—not a bug—so understanding *why* Python works this way is more valuable than memorizing the behavior.
