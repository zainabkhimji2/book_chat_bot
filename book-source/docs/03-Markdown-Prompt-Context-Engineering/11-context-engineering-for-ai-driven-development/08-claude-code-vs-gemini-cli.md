# Claude Code vs Gemini CLI - Choosing the Right Tool

## Introduction: Why Two Tools?

You've been using Claude Code and Gemini CLI throughout this chapter. But WHY two tools? When do you choose one over the other?

**This lesson gives you the decision framework.**

**The Analogy:**

**Kitchen knives:**
- **Chef's knife**: All-purpose, precise control, best for most tasks
- **Bread knife**: Serrated, handles large volumes, best for specific tasks

**Same with AI tools:**
- **Claude Code**: All-purpose, deep reasoning, best for most development
- **Gemini CLI**: Massive context, pattern analysis, best for large codebases

**Neither is "better" - they're designed for different scenarios.**

---

## Core Differences: Context Management

### Claude Code: Smart Context Window (200K tokens)

**How it works:**
- **Context window:** ~200,000 tokens (~150,000 words)
- **Context strategy:** Selective loading - you explicitly tell it what to read
- **File handling:** Reads specific files you mention
- **Memory:** Conversation-based, degrades over long sessions

**Estimate:**
- 200K tokens ≈ 450-500 files (400 lines each)
- But you typically load 10-30 files at a time

**Example:**
```bash
claude "Read these files:
- src/services/user_service.py
- src/models/user.py
- tests/test_user_service.py

Then implement password reset functionality"
```

---

### Gemini CLI: Massive Context Window (1M-2M tokens)

**How it works:**
- **Context window:** ~1,000,000 tokens (~750,000 words) for Gemini 1.5 Pro, ~2,000,000 for Flash
- **Context strategy:** Bulk loading - can read entire directories
- **File handling:** Can ingest 100+ files at once
- **Memory:** Same conversation-based, degrades similarly

**Estimate:**
- 1M tokens ≈ 2,000-2,500 files (400 lines each)
- Can load entire medium-sized codebases

**Example:**
```bash
gemini chat --session analysis "Read all files in src/ directory (120 files).

Create a comprehensive architecture report:
1. List all services and their dependencies
2. Identify duplicated code patterns
3. Find potential security issues
4. Suggest refactoring priorities"
```

---

## Context Window Comparison Table

| Feature | Claude Code | Gemini CLI |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Context Size** | 200K tokens | 1M-2M tokens |
| **Files at Once** | 10-30 typical | 100-500+ possible |
| **Best For** | Focused implementation | Large-scale analysis |
| **Load Strategy** | Explicit selection | Bulk ingestion |
| **Context Control** | High (you curate) | Medium (reads all) |

---

## Tool Strengths: When to Use Which

### Claude Code Strengths

#### 1. Deep Reasoning and Problem-Solving

Claude excels at **complex logical reasoning**.

**Example Task:** Design authentication system with multiple edge cases

```bash
claude "Design a JWT authentication system with these requirements:

1. Access tokens (15 minutes)
2. Refresh tokens (7 days)
3. Token rotation on refresh
4. Revocation support (logout)
5. Concurrent session limits (max 3 devices)
6. Suspicious activity detection

Design the system architecture, database schema, and security measures."
```

**Why Claude Code:** Requires deep reasoning about security, edge cases, race conditions.

---

#### 2. Refactoring and Code Quality

Claude is excellent at **improving existing code**.

**Example Task:** Refactor messy authentication code

```bash
claude "Read src/auth/legacy_auth.py

This code has several issues:
- 400 lines in one function
- No error handling
- Direct database access (no repository pattern)
- Hardcoded secrets
- No tests

Refactor into clean architecture:
1. Extract service layer
2. Add repository pattern
3. Use dependency injection
4. Add error handling
5. Remove hardcoded secrets"
```

**Why Claude Code:** Understands code smell, architectural patterns, best practices deeply.

---

#### 3. Architecture Design

Claude excels at **system design and architecture**.

**Example Task:** Design microservices architecture

```bash
claude "We're splitting a monolith into microservices.

Current structure: src/ has users, products, orders, payments all mixed.

Design microservices:
1. Service boundaries (what goes where)
2. Inter-service communication (sync vs async)
3. Data ownership (which service owns which data)
4. API contracts
5. Migration strategy (how to transition)

Consider: ACID transactions, distributed systems challenges, eventual consistency"
```

**Why Claude Code:** Deep understanding of distributed systems patterns, tradeoffs, pitfalls.

---

#### 4. Test-Driven Development

Claude writes **high-quality tests**.

**Example Task:** Create comprehensive test suite

```bash
claude "Read src/services/payment_service.py

Create a complete test suite with:

1. Unit tests for each method
2. Integration tests with mock payment gateway
3. Edge cases:
   - Network failures
   - Duplicate charges (idempotency)
   - Race conditions (concurrent payments)
4. Security tests:
   - Injection attacks
   - Invalid amounts (negative, zero, huge)
5. Aim for 95%+ coverage"
```

**Why Claude Code:** Thinks through edge cases, security issues, proper test structure.

---

### Gemini CLI Strengths

#### 1. Large Codebase Analysis

Gemini excels at **reading and analyzing entire projects**.

**Example Task:** Analyze 200-file legacy codebase

```bash
gemini chat --session analysis "Read all Python files in src/ (200 files, 80,000 lines total).

Provide comprehensive report:

1. **Architecture Overview:**
   - What are the main components?
   - How do they interact?
   - Draw dependency graph

2. **Code Quality:**
   - Duplicate code (list specific examples)
   - Long functions (>100 lines)
   - High complexity areas

3. **Security Issues:**
   - Hardcoded credentials
   - SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Missing input validation

4. **Refactoring Priorities:**
   - Top 10 files that need immediate attention
   - Reason for each"
```

**Why Gemini CLI:** Can ingest entire codebase, find patterns across hundreds of files.

---

#### 2. Pattern Detection Across Files

Gemini finds **patterns and inconsistencies** across many files.

**Example Task:** Find all API endpoints and their patterns

```bash
gemini chat --session patterns "Read all files in src/api/routes/ (45 files).

Create report:

1. List ALL API endpoints (URL, method, handler)
2. Identify patterns:
   - Authentication patterns (which endpoints require auth?)
   - Error handling patterns (consistent or inconsistent?)
   - Validation patterns (where is input validation?)
3. Find inconsistencies:
   - Endpoints that don't follow the standard pattern
   - Missing error handling
   - Inconsistent response formats"
```

**Why Gemini CLI:** Processes 45 files at once, compares patterns systematically.

---

#### 3. Documentation Generation

Gemini excels at **creating comprehensive docs** from code.

**Example Task:** Generate API documentation from codebase

```bash
gemini chat --session docs "Read:
- All route files (src/api/routes/*.py - 30 files)
- All schema files (src/schemas/*.py - 25 files)
- All model files (src/models/*.py - 20 files)

Generate OpenAPI specification with:
1. All endpoints with descriptions
2. Request/response schemas
3. Error codes
4. Authentication requirements
5. Example requests/responses

Output as openapi.yaml"
```

**Why Gemini CLI:** Reads all 75 files, synthesizes into complete documentation.

---

#### 4. Migration Analysis

Gemini is excellent for **planning large migrations**.

**Example Task:** Plan Python 2 to Python 3 migration

```bash
gemini chat --session migration "Read entire codebase (src/, tests/ - 300 files total).

Create migration plan for Python 2 to Python 3:

1. **Inventory:**
   - Which files use Python 2 syntax?
   - Which libraries need upgrading?
   
2. **Breaking Changes:**
   - Where is print statement used? (needs print() function)
   - Where is / division used? (// vs /)
   - Unicode handling issues

3. **Migration Order:**
   - Which files to migrate first? (least dependencies)
   - Which files are most critical?
   
4. **Risk Assessment:**
   - High-risk changes
   - Files needing manual review"
```

**Why Gemini CLI:** Analyzes all 300 files, finds every occurrence of problematic patterns.

## Scenario-Based Decision Guide

### Scenario 1: Building a New User Registration Feature

**Task:** Implement user registration with email verification.

**Which tool?** **Claude Code**

**Why:**
- Involves 5-8 files (small scope)
- Requires deep reasoning (security, validation, edge cases)
- Needs test-driven development
- Architecture design for email workflow

```bash
claude "Build user registration feature:
- Email/password registration
- Email verification (send token, verify link)
- Password strength requirements
- Duplicate email handling
- Rate limiting

Include: services, models, routes, schemas, tests"
```

---

### Scenario 2: Understanding a Legacy Codebase

**Task:** You just joined a team with 150-file legacy codebase. Need to understand architecture.

**Which tool?** **Gemini CLI**

**Why:**
- Large codebase (150 files)
- Need overview, not deep changes yet
- Want to see relationships and patterns
- Documentation might be missing

```bash
gemini chat --session onboarding "Read all files in src/ (150 files).

Create onboarding guide:
1. What is this application? (infer from code)
2. Main components and their purposes
3. How do components interact?
4. Entry points (where does execution start?)
5. Database schema (what tables exist?)
6. API endpoints (what can users do?)
7. Common patterns used
8. Areas that need improvement"
```

---

### Scenario 3: Refactoring Authentication Code

**Task:** Current auth code is 500 lines in one file. Need to refactor.

**Which tool?** **Claude Code**

**Why:**
- Code quality and refactoring is Claude's strength
- Small scope (1 file, even if large)
- Requires architectural expertise
- Need to apply design patterns

```bash
claude "Read src/auth/authentication.py (500 lines).

Refactor using:
1. Service layer pattern
2. Repository pattern for data access
3. Strategy pattern for different auth methods (JWT, OAuth, API keys)
4. Extract validators into separate module
5. Comprehensive error handling

Show before/after structure and implementation."
```

---

### Scenario 4: Finding All Database Queries

**Task:** Need to audit all database queries for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Which tool?** **Gemini CLI**

**Why:**
- Need to scan entire codebase (many files)
- Pattern detection task
- Generate comprehensive report

```bash
gemini chat --session audit "Read all Python files (src/, tests/ - 200 files).

Find every database query:
1. Raw SQL queries (potential SQL injection)
2. ORM queries (safer, but check for raw() calls)
3. List files and line numbers
4. Categorize by risk:
   - HIGH: Raw SQL with user input
   - MEDIUM: Parameterized but complex
   - LOW: ORM queries
5. Provide fix recommendations for HIGH risk"
```

---

### Scenario 5: Debugging a Specific Bug

**Task:** Users report: "Can't reset password after 3 failed login attempts."

**Which tool?** **Claude Code**

**Why:**
- Small scope (password reset + login attempts)
- Requires debugging reasoning
- Might need to understand edge case logic

```bash
claude "Read:
- src/auth/login.py
- src/auth/password_reset.py
- tests/test_auth.py (if exists)

Bug: Users can't reset password after 3 failed login attempts.

Debug:
1. Understand the failed login attempt logic
2. Understand the password reset logic
3. Find the connection (is account locked?)
4. Identify the bug
5. Propose fix with test"
```

---

### Scenario 6: Migrating from REST to GraphQL

**Task:** Plan migration of 40 REST endpoints to GraphQL.

**Which tool?** **Gemini CLI first, then Claude Code**

**Why:** 
- Start with Gemini (read all 40 endpoints, analyze patterns)
- Then use Claude (design GraphQL schema, implement resolvers)

```bash
# Phase 1: Analysis (Gemini)
gemini chat --session graphql "Read all route files (src/api/routes/ - 40 files).

Analyze for GraphQL migration:
1. List all endpoints (URL, method, purpose)
2. Identify related endpoints (what becomes GraphQL relationships?)
3. Data models used (what becomes GraphQL types?)
4. Authentication patterns
5. Suggest GraphQL schema structure"

# Phase 2: Implementation (Claude)
claude "Based on the analysis, implement GraphQL schema and resolvers for User resource:
- User type definition
- Queries (user, users)
- Mutations (createUser, updateUser, deleteUser)
- Relationships (user.posts, user.comments)
Include: schema, resolvers, tests"
```

---

## Hybrid Workflow Strategies

For complex projects, **use both tools** in sequence.

### Pattern 1: Analysis → Implementation

**Workflow:**
1. **Gemini:** Analyze entire codebase
2. **Claude:** Implement specific feature

**Example: Adding GraphQL to REST API**

```bash
# Step 1: Analysis (Gemini)
gemini chat --session analysis "Read all API routes (40 files) and analyze patterns"

# Step 2: Design (Claude)
claude "Based on this analysis, design GraphQL schema for top 10 most-used endpoints"

# Step 3: Implement (Claude)
claude "Implement the User and Post GraphQL resolvers with tests"
```

---

### Pattern 2: Design → Bulk Generation → Refinement

**Workflow:**
1. **Claude:** Design pattern/template
2. **Gemini:** Apply pattern to many files
3. **Claude:** Refine specific implementations

**Example: Adding OpenAPI docs to 40 endpoints**

```bash
# Step 1: Design template (Claude)
claude "Design OpenAPI documentation pattern for our API routes.

Create template with:
- Summary and description
- Request/response schemas
- Error responses
- Examples

Show template for one endpoint (POST /users)"

# Step 2: Apply to all (Gemini)
gemini chat --session docs "Read all 40 route files.

Apply the OpenAPI template to each endpoint. Generate complete openapi.yaml."

# Step 3: Refine complex endpoints (Claude)
claude "The Payment endpoint has complex logic. Improve its OpenAPI doc with detailed examples and all edge cases."
```

---

### Pattern 3: Bulk Detection → Targeted Fixes

**Workflow:**
1. **Gemini:** Find all instances of a problem
2. **Claude:** Fix each instance with proper reasoning

**Example: Fixing SQL injection vulnerabilities**

```bash
# Step 1: Find all issues (Gemini)
gemini chat --session audit "Scan entire codebase (200 files).

Find all raw SQL queries with user input:
- List file, line number, code snippet
- Categorize by risk level
- Prioritize fixes"

# Step 2: Fix high-risk issues (Claude)
claude "Read src/api/routes/user_search.py line 45.

This raw SQL query is vulnerable:
query = f\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{user_input}'\"

Fix it:
1. Use parameterized query
2. Add input validation
3. Add sanitization
4. Add test for SQL injection attempt"
```

---

## Best Practices for Each Tool

### Claude Code Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Explicitly list files to read (context curation)
- Break complex tasks into steps
- Use for test-driven development
- Ask for explanations of design choices
- Request refactoring with architectural patterns

❌ **DON'T:**
- Ask to read 50+ files at once (use Gemini for that)
- Assume Claude has full codebase context
- Use for bulk pattern detection across many files

**Good Prompt Example:**
```bash
claude "Read:
- src/services/user_service.py
- src/models/user.py
- tests/test_user_service.py

Implement 'change email' feature:
1. Validate new email
2. Check for duplicates
3. Send verification to new email
4. Update email only after verification
5. Include comprehensive tests"
```

---

### Gemini CLI Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Use for large-scale analysis (50+ files)
- Request comprehensive reports
- Ask for pattern detection
- Use for documentation generation
- Request dependency mapping

❌ **DON'T:**
- Expect deep architectural reasoning (use Claude)
- Use for complex algorithm design
- Rely on for security-critical logic
- Use for refactoring (Claude is better)

**Good Prompt Example:**
```bash
gemini chat --session analysis "Read entire src/ directory (150 files).

Generate architecture report:
1. Component diagram (what exists?)
2. Dependency graph (what depends on what?)
3. Database schema (inferred from models)
4. API surface (all endpoints)
5. Code quality metrics (file size, complexity, duplication)
6. Security audit (common vulnerabilities)
7. Refactoring priorities (top 10 files)

Output as markdown report."
```

---

## Cost and Performance Considerations

### Token Usage

**Claude Code (200K window):**
- **Cost:** ~$3 per 1M input tokens, $15 per 1M output tokens
- **Session:** Reading 20 files (8,000 lines) ≈ 10K tokens ≈ $0.03

**Gemini CLI (1M window):**
- **Cost:** ~$1.25 per 1M input tokens, $5 per 1M output tokens (Flash version even cheaper)
- **Session:** Reading 100 files (40,000 lines) ≈ 50K tokens ≈ $0.06

**Cost Efficiency:**
- Gemini is cheaper per token
- But Claude produces better quality for complex reasoning
- **Strategy:** Use Gemini for bulk analysis, Claude for critical implementation

---

### Response Speed

**Claude Code:**
- **Faster** for focused tasks (smaller context = faster processing)
- Streaming output feels responsive

**Gemini CLI:**
- **Slower** for massive context (needs to process 1M tokens)
- But saves multiple round-trips

**Speed Strategy:**
- Claude for iterative development (quick feedback loop)
- Gemini for batch analysis (run overnight for large reports)

---

## Validation Checkpoint

### ✅ Can You Choose the Right Tool?

**Test yourself with these scenarios:**

| Scenario | Your Answer | Correct Tool |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Build a new authentication feature | ? | Claude Code (reasoning + architecture) |
| Analyze 200-file legacy codebase | ? | Gemini CLI (massive context) |
| Refactor messy payment processing code | ? | Claude Code (refactoring expertise) |
| Find all API endpoints and document them | ? | Gemini CLI (pattern detection across files) |
| Debug race condition in checkout flow | ? | Claude Code (complex logical reasoning) |
| Audit codebase for security issues | ? | Gemini CLI (bulk scanning) |

---

## Try With AI

Practice choosing and using both tools.

### Exercise 1: Tool Selection Practice

**Task:** For each scenario, state which tool and why.

```bash
# With Claude Code
claude "I'll give you 5 development scenarios.

For each, tell me: Should I use Claude Code or Gemini CLI? Why?

Scenarios:
1. I need to add two-factor authentication (Google Authenticator TOTP)
2. I have a 300-file codebase and need to understand the architecture
3. I need to refactor 500 lines of authentication code into clean services
4. I need to find all places where we make HTTP requests and standardize error handling
5. I need to design a distributed caching strategy for our microservices"
```

---

### Exercise 2: Hybrid Workflow Design

```bash
# With Gemini CLI
gemini chat "Design a hybrid workflow using both Claude Code and Gemini CLI for this task:

Task: Migrate 50 REST API endpoints to add rate limiting.

Create workflow:
1. What does Gemini do first?
2. What does Claude do next?
3. When do you switch between tools?
4. What's the output at each stage?

Explain reasoning for each tool choice."
```

---

### Exercise 3: Real Comparison

Run the same task with both tools and compare results.

```bash
# With Claude Code
claude "Read src/models/user.py

Explain the User model: fields, relationships, validation rules."

# With Gemini CLI
gemini chat --session compare "Read src/models/user.py

Explain the User model: fields, relationships, validation rules."
```

**Compare:**
- Which gave better explanation?
- Which was faster?
- Which noticed more details?
