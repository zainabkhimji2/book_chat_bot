# Your Team Needs Shared Rules: Memory Banks and Constitutions

## The Problem You Haven't Faced Yet

Imagine you're on a team of 5 developers. Each person writes their own password reset feature for different projects.

Developer A uses bcrypt (secure)
Developer B uses MD5 (insecure)
Developer C doesn't hash at all (catastrophic)

Each developer has a spec for their password reset system. Each spec says "use secure hashing." But they interpreted it differently.

**Result**: Your system is inconsistent and insecure.

---

## The Solution: Shared Rules That Apply to Everything

Instead of assuming everyone knows "password reset should be secure," you write rules that apply to EVERY feature.

These rules have names: **Memory Banks** (Kiro framework) or **Constitutions** (Spec-Kit framework).

**They're basically: the rules that govern your entire system.**

### How to Scale Specs Across Teams

**The Challenge**: You're on a team of 5 developers. Each person writes different features. How do you ensure everyone follows the same security, architecture, and quality standards without constant meetings?

**The Solution**: Create a **Memory Bank** (Kiro framework) or **Constitution** (Spec-Kit framework). This document lists rules that apply to **every feature**:

- ALL passwords use bcrypt
- ALL APIs are rate-limited
- ALL code has 80%+ test coverage
- ALL data is encrypted in transit

Every developer reads this before writing code. Every AI agent follows these rules. **Consistency becomes automatic.**

---

## What Goes in a Memory Bank / Constitution?

### 1. Product Vision

```
We're building a healthcare scheduling platform. Our core promise:
"Scheduling in under 30 seconds. No phone calls, no back-and-forth."
```

**Why**: Developers know what problem they're solving. Decisions align with vision.

### 2. Architecture Patterns

```
- All endpoints follow FastAPI patterns
- All services use repository pattern for data
- All databases accessed through SQLAlchemy ORM
- All errors follow standard error response format
```

**Why**: New developers don't reinvent wheels. Consistency.

### 3. Technology Stack

```
Backend: Python 3.13+, FastAPI
Database: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (cache)
Testing: Pytest
Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes
```

**Why**: Developers know what tools they're using. No tool debates.

### 4. Security Rules (Non-Negotiable)

```
- ALL user data encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- ALL data in transit over TLS 1.3+
- ALL passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost 12+)
- NEVER log passwords, tokens, or sensitive data
- ALL endpoints require authentication (JWT)
```

**Why**: Security is default, not an afterthought. No vulnerable implementations.

### 5. Quality Standards

```
- Minimum test coverage: 80% per file
- All functions have docstrings
- All code formatted with Black (automatic)
- Type hints on all functions (mypy strict mode)
```

**Why**: Quality is measurable. CI enforces it.

### 6. Common Patterns and Anti-Patterns

```
DO THIS: Use service + repository pattern
  service calls → repository calls → database

DON'T DO THIS: Database calls scattered through endpoints
  (makes code hard to maintain)
```

**Why**: Developers learn patterns by example.

---

## How It Works in Practice

### Scenario: Developer writes password reset feature

**Step 1: Read the Constitution**

Developer reads:

```
- Passwords MUST use bcrypt (cost 12+)
- NEVER log sensitive data
- ALL endpoints require rate limiting
- ALL code must have 80%+ tests
```

**Step 2: Write spec aligned with Constitution**

Developer writes password reset spec:

```
## Non-Functional Requirements
- Password hashing: bcrypt cost 12+ (per Constitution)
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per hour (per Constitution)
- No logging of tokens (per Constitution)
- Test coverage: 80%+ (per Constitution)
```

**Step 3: Generate code**

Code is generated. It automatically:

- ✅ Uses bcrypt (no option to use MD5)
- ✅ Implements rate limiting (required by Constitution)
- ✅ Never logs tokens (Constitution rule enforced)
- ✅ Has tests for 80%+ coverage (Constitutional requirement)

**Step 4: Code review**

Reviewer checks: "Does code follow Constitution?"
Always yes, because Constitution was enforced in step 1-3.

---

## The Power at Scale

**Without Constitution:**

- 5 developers
- Each makes security decisions independently
- Some use bcrypt, some use MD5, some use nothing
- Security is chaotic
- Code review has to check everything

**With Constitution:**

- 5 developers
- Constitution says "bcrypt always"
- All developers implement bcrypt (no debate)
- Security is consistent
- Code review can focus on logic, not security basics

Now imagine 50 developers, or 500 developers. Constitution doesn't scale linearly. It scales exponentially: **More developers → more need for shared rules.**

---

## Ask Your Companion: Build a Constitution for Your System

Tell your companion:

```
Help me draft a Constitution for a healthcare scheduling app. What rules
should apply to every feature? Think: security, architecture, quality,
compliance.
```

Your companion will help you draft.

---

## The Key Insight

**Specifications are feature-specific. Constitutions are system-wide.**

- **Spec**: "How should password reset work?"
- **Constitution**: "How should ALL code handle security, quality, testing?"

Specs drive individual features. Constitutions ensure consistency across ALL features.

---


## Beyond Constitution: Capturing the Journey and Decisions

A Constitution defines **what rules we follow**. But as your team develops software, two other critical questions emerge:

1. **How did we learn what works?** (The journey of discovery)
2. **Why did we choose this approach?** (The rationale behind mutable decisions)

Two additional artifacts address these questions: **Prompt History Records (PHR)** and **Architectural Decision Records (ADR)**.

---

### Prompt History Records (PHR): Capturing the Journey

**The Problem**: When AI-generated code fails, how do you debug it? When a spec works perfectly, how do you learn why it succeeded? Without a record of your AI interactions, knowledge is lost.

**The Solution**: PHR = Structured log of all AI interactions during development.

#### Why PHRs Matter

**1. Debugging**: When generated code doesn't work as expected

```
Problem: Password reset emails not sending
↓
Check PHR: What did we ask AI to generate?
↓
PHR shows: "Generate password reset with email notification"
↓
Insight: We never specified SMTP configuration in the spec!
↓
Solution: Update spec with email configuration details
```

**2. Learning**: Patterns emerge showing which prompts produce better results

```
PHR Analysis after 3 months:
- Prompts with explicit error handling: 95% success rate
- Prompts without error handling: 60% success rate
→ Team learns: Always specify error handling in specs
```

**3. Collaboration**: Team members understand reasoning path, not just final code

```
New developer joins team:
"Why did we use JWT instead of sessions for password reset?"
↓
Check PHR from that feature:
↓
Shows full discussion: Security Subagent recommended JWT,
team discussed trade-offs, chose JWT for stateless scaling
↓
New developer understands context without meeting
```
---

### Architectural Decision Records (ADR): Documenting Mutable Decisions

**Constitution = Immutable**: "ALL passwords use bcrypt" (never changes)  
**ADR = Mutable**: "For this feature, we chose JWT over sessions because..." (might change)

#### Understanding the Difference

**Constitution**: System-wide principles that rarely change

- "All passwords use bcrypt cost 12+"
- "Test coverage must exceed 80%"
- "All data encrypted in transit"

**ADR**: Feature-specific decisions that might evolve

- "Use JWT for password reset tokens" (might switch to sessions later)
- "30-minute token expiry" (might adjust based on user feedback)
- "Email-only reset" (might add SMS backup in future)

#### When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR for:

- ✅ Significant architecture decisions (database choice, auth pattern, API design)
- ✅ Trade-offs between competing approaches (performance vs simplicity)
- ✅ Deviations from obvious/standard patterns (why we didn't use the common approach)
- ✅ Decisions that future developers will question ("Why did they choose this?")

Don't write an ADR for:

- ❌ Decisions covered by Constitution (those are already documented)
- ❌ Trivial implementation details (variable naming, minor refactoring)
- ❌ Temporary workarounds (document in code comments instead)

## The Power at Scale Revisited

**Without SDD**:

- 5 developers make independent decisions
- Some use JWT, some use sessions, some use both
- No one knows why decisions were made
- New developers ask same questions repeatedly
- AI agents make inconsistent choices

**With SDD and an Opinionated Tools:**

- Constitution: "Auth pattern is JWT" (everyone follows)
- ADR: "Why JWT? Because..." (everyone understands)
- Spec: "This feature uses JWT per ADR-001" (consistent implementation)
- PHR: "AI generated this based on ADR-001" (traceable)
- New developers: Read ADRs, understand context, continue pattern

**Result**: Consistency emerges not just from rules (Constitution), but from shared understanding (ADRs) and institutional learning (PHRs).

## Your Reflection

**Questions:**

1. **What rules would YOUR Constitution include?**

   - Security rules for your domain?
   - Architecture patterns you want everyone to follow?
   - Quality standards?
   - Technology choices?

2. **How would a Constitution change your team's work?**

   - Less debate about "should we use bcrypt or MD5?" (Constitution says bcrypt)
   - Faster code review (Constitution compliance checked automatically)
   - More consistent codebase
   - Easier onboarding (new devs read Constitution, understand rules)

3. **Where do specs and Constitution meet?**
   - Specs implement the Constitution
   - Constitution enforces quality across all specs
   - No conflict: they work together

---

**Professional teams don't debate fundamentals every project.**

They write down the rules (Constitution / Memory Bank). Everyone follows them. Consistency emerges.

This is how teams scale without chaos.
