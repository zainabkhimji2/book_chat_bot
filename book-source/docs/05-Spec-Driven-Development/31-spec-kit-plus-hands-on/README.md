# Chapter 31: Spec-Kit Plus Hands-On

Welcome to hands-on specification-driven development. This chapter transforms understanding (from Chapter 30) into practice. You won't read about specifications-you'll write them. You won't learn about AI collaboration - you'll build project with your AI companion from specifications to implementation.

## From Chapter 30 to Chapter 31

**Chapter 30** taught you the foundations:
- Why specification-driven development matters (the vague code problem)
- What SDD is (spec-first, spec-anchored, spec-as-source levels)
- How to write your first spec (calculator exercise)
- Why teams need shared rules (Constitutions, ADRs, PHRs)
- When SDD became essential (AI convergence moment)
- Which tools exist (Kiro, Spec-Kit, **Spec-Kit Plus**, Tessel)

**Chapter 31** teaches you the workflow:
- How to install and configure Spec-Kit Plus
- How to create project Constitutions
- How to collaborate with AI on specifications
- How to refine specs iteratively
- How to generate plans and document decisions (ADRs)
- How to decompose work with checkpoint-driven execution
- How to implement with validation protocols
- How to complete end-to-end workflows independently

**The Bridge**: Chapter 30 gave you the map. Chapter 31 teaches you to drive.

## What You'll Learn

By completing this chapter, you'll master:

1. **Spec-Kit Plus Architecture** - Understand Horizontal Intelligence (ADRs + PHRs) and Vertical Intelligence (orchestrator + subagents)
2. **Evals-First Collaboration** - How to explore problem space with AI BEFORE writing formal specifications
3. **Constitution Creation** - Setting project-wide quality standards that cascade to all features
4. **Specification Writing** - Creating clear, testable requirements using SMART criteria
5. **Iterative Refinement** - Using `/sp.clarify` to identify and resolve specification gaps
6. **Architecture Planning** - Generating implementation plans and documenting decisions with ADRs
7. **Task Decomposition** - Breaking plans into atomic work units with checkpoint-driven execution
8. **AI-Driven Implementation** - Orchestrating code generation with systematic validation protocols
9. **Independent Workflow** - Applying all skills end-to-end without guidance

Most importantly, you'll build the muscle memory for specification-first thinking that makes you dramatically faster in Chapters 32 and beyond. Let's build something real.
