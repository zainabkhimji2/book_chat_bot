# Constitution Phase - Project-Wide Rules

Welcome to the second lesson of hands-on Spec-Kit Plus development. You've installed the framework and configured your AI tool. Now it's time to create the **foundational rules** that will guide every part of your calculator project.

The Constitution is Spec-Kit Plus's answer to a critical question: **What standards apply to every piece of work you do?** Not just for this feature, but for all features. Not just this week, but for the life of the project.

Imagine you and your computer helper are a team building a giant LEGO castle. Before you start, you need to agree on some rules so you don't mess things up.

*   What if you want all the towers to be **square**, but your helper starts building **round** ones?
*   What if you decide the roof must be **blue**, but your helper builds a **red** one?

That would be a mess!

The **Constitution** is your team's **Rulebook**. It lists the most important rules that both you and your computer helper **MUST** follow, no matter what. It makes sure you both build the project the exact same way, every single time.

## What Is a Constitution? 

Before writing one, let's understand what a Constitution actually is and why it matters.

### Constitution: Global Rules, One Per Project

A **Constitution** is a document that defines **immutable standards** applying to **all features** in a project. It's distinct from a **Specification**, which applies to **one feature**.

**Constitution applies to**:
- Code quality standards (type hints, docstrings, naming conventions)
- Testing requirements (unit tests, integration tests, coverage targets)
- Error handling patterns (exception hierarchy, error messages, logging)
- Security practices (no hardcoded secrets, input validation, data handling)
- Documentation expectations (README, code comments, docstrings)

**Specification applies to**:
- Specific feature requirements (calculator should add, subtract, multiply, etc.)
- User stories for that feature
- Acceptance criteria for that feature
- Edge cases specific to that feature

**Example**:

```
CONSTITUTION (applies to ALL features):
  ✅ "All functions must have type hints"
  ✅ "All code must be 100% test-covered"

SPECIFICATION (applies only to CALCULATOR feature):
  ✅ "Calculator must support add, subtract, multiply, divide, power"
  ✅ "Power operation handles negative exponents"
  ✅ "Results return float with 6-decimal precision"
```

### Why Constitution Matters: The Cascade

The Constitution is the **starting point of the cascade**:

```
Clear Constitution
    ↓
(ensures that every spec follows quality standards)
    ↓
Clear Specification
    ↓
(ensures that planning is feasible)
    ↓
Clear Plan
    ↓
(ensures that tasks are well-defined)
    ↓
Clear Tasks
    ↓
(enables correct code generation)
    ↓
Working Code
```

**Weak Constitution** produces:
- Specs that are vague about error handling
- Plans that don't account for testing
- Code that's missing type hints
- Integration issues because standards weren't enforced upstream

**Strong Constitution** produces:
- Specs that automatically include quality criteria
- Plans with testing built in
- Code that's consistent and maintainable
- Integration that works because standards were clear from the start

### Constitution is One-Time, Feature Work is Repetitive

This is crucial: You write the Constitution **once per project**. Then, for each feature, you:

1. Write a specification (addressing this feature only)
2. Generate a plan
3. Generate tasks
4. Implement code

But you never rewrite the Constitution for each feature. It's the foundation everything builds on.

**Best Practice Pattern**:

```
1. Initialize project
2. Write Constitution
3. Commit Constitution to git
4. FOR EACH FEATURE:
   - Run /sp.specify (new specification)
   - Run /sp.clarify (refine specification)
   - Run /sp.plan (new plan for this feature)
   - Run /sp.tasks (new tasks for this feature)
   - Run /sp.implement (new code for this feature)
   - Commit feature to git
```

## Reading Existing Constitutions (15 minutes)

Before writing your own, let's look at base Constitution file. Open:

```bash
.specify/memory/constitution.md
```

Remember the Goal: document the non-negotiable principles that every spec, plan, and task must honor.

**The Key Insight**: Constitutions are project-specific. Your calculator Constitution would never mention "data lineage" because that's not relevant. A data pipeline Constitution wouldn't need type hints or power operations.

## Part B: Writing Your Calculator Constitution

Now let's write YOUR Constitution for the calculator project.

### Step 1: Create the Constitution

In your project directory

1. Start agent chat type `/sp.constitution`.
2. Now we have to explain our requirements i.e::
```
/sp.constitution 

Project principles and standards:
- Write tests first (TDD approach)
- Use Python 3.12+ with type hints everywhere
- Keep code clean and easy to read
- Document important decisions with ADRs
- Follow essential OOP principles: SOLID, DRY, KISS

Technical stack:
- Python 3.12+ with UV package manager
- pytest for testing
- Keep all project files in git

Quality requirements:
- All tests must pass
- At least 80% code coverage
- Use dataclasses for data structures
```

3. Agent Does:
  - Creates comprehensive constitution file
  - Sets up project standards and OOP principles
  - Defines coding principles and best practices
  - Establishes technical preferences and quality gates

### Step 2: Improve your Constitution

Think about what "good code" means for a calculator project:

```markdown
Update @.specify/memory/constitution.md to improve Code Quality Standards

- All functions must include type hints on parameters and return types
  - Example: `def add(a: float, b: float) -> float:`
- All functions must include docstrings explaining what they do
  - Example: `"""Add two numbers and return the sum."""`
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions (lowercase_with_underscores for functions)
- Lines must be under 100 characters
- No magic numbers; use named constants
  - Bad: `if x > 10:`
  - Good: `if x > MAX_POWER_EXPONENT:`
```

**Try writing 3-4 quality standards for your calculator. Think about**:
- How will you know if code is "good"?
- What would "bad" code look like?
- What would make code hard to maintain?

### Step 3: Review and Complete Your Constitution 

**Your Prompt:**

```
Show me the generated constitution file and explain what it contains.
```

**Agent Does:**

- Displays the constitution content
- Explains each section:
  - **Project Principles** - Core development philosophy and OOP principles
  - **Technical Standards** - Code quality, structure, and best practices
  - **Testing Requirements** - TDD and coverage standards
  - **Architecture Decisions** - When to create ADRs and design patterns
  - **Quality Gates** - CI/CD requirements and code quality checks
  
---

## Part C: Commit Constitution to Git (15 minutes)

Here's a critical best practice: **Always commit the Constitution before starting feature work.**

### Why Commit First?

1. **Immutability**: Constitution is foundational; committing it signals "this is our standard"
2. **Clarity**: Everyone (including your AI orchestrator) sees the Constitution as the baseline
3. **Traceability**: Git history shows when and why Constitution was created
4. **Reversibility**: If you need to, you can revert to a previous Constitution (rarely happens, but important)

### Commit Steps

**Your Prompt**

Use the agent to commit and open a PR for the constitution:

```
/sp.git.commit_pr Commit and push the constitution along with current work.
```

**Agent Does:**

- Create a conventional commit for the constitution and push to a new feature branch
- Create a draft PR (or share the compare URL if `gh` auth is missing)


The Constitution is now **the foundation** for all your feature work. Every specification you write, every plan you generate, every task you break down-they all work within the Constitution's constraints.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Copying Constitution from Another Project Without Customization

**The Error**: "I'll just use the example Constitution as-is for my calculator."

**Why It's Wrong**: Constitutions are project-specific. A data pipeline Constitution mentions "data lineage" - irrelevant for calculators.

**The Fix**: Read example Constitutions for structure, but write rules specific to YOUR project needs.

### Mistake 2: Vague Quality Standards

**The Error**: "Code must be good quality" or "Tests should be comprehensive"

**Why It's Wrong**: "Good" and "comprehensive" are subjective. No one can verify these during code review.

**The Fix**: Use testable criteria:
- ❌ Vague: "Good code quality"
- ✅ Testable: "All functions have type hints; lines under 100 characters; no magic numbers"

## Try With AI: Validate Your Constitution

Now let's use your AI companion to review your Constitution and ensure it's clear enough that specs, plans, and code can build on it without ambiguity.

### Setup

**Tool**: Claude Code (or your configured AI orchestrator)
**Goal**: Ensure Constitution is clear, testable, and specific enough to guide downstream work

### Prompt Set (Copy-Paste Ready)

**Prompt 1 - Constitution Clarity Check**

Copy and paste this into Claude Code:

```
I've written a Constitution for my calculator project. Please review it for clarity:

1. Are all rules testable? (Can you verify during code review?)
2. Are any rules vague or ambiguous?
3. Do I cover the essential categories (quality, error handling, types, testing)?

Here's my Constitution:
@.specify/memory/constitution.md

Please identify any rules that need clarification.
```

**Prompt 2 - Cascade Validation**

After reviewing clarity, ask:

```
Now imagine I'm writing a specification for the calculator's divide operation.
Looking at my Constitution, what constraints must my spec respect?

- What error handling must the divide spec include?
- What type system rules must divide follow?
- What testing requirements must divide meet?

This helps me understand if my Constitution is specific enough to guide specs.
```

**Prompt 3 - Reality Check**

Finally, ask:

```
Is my Constitution realistic for a calculator project, or am I being too strict?
Any advice on making it more practical without sacrificing quality?
```

### Expected Outcomes

After these prompts, you should understand:

- **Constitution clarity**: Rules are testable and specific (not vague philosophy)
- **Cascade impact**: You can trace how Constitution rules flow into specifications
- **Realism**: Standards are ambitious but achievable
- **Readiness**: You're prepared to write specifications that respect the Constitution
