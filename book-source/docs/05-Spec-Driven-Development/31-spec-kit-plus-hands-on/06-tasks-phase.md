# Tasks Phase - Atomic Work Units and Checkpoints

You now have:
- ✅ A clear specification
- ✅ A detailed implementation plan
- ✅ Documented architecture decisions (ADRs)

Next: Break the plan into **atomic work units** (tasks) that you'll implement.

This lesson teaches the **checkpoint pattern**-the critical workflow practice that keeps YOU in control. The pattern is:

```
Agent: "Here's Phase 1 code"
You: "Review... looks good!"
You: "Commit to git"
You: "Tell me what's next"
Agent: "Phase 2"
```

NOT:

```
Agent: "Here's everything" (no human control)
```

The difference is huge. Checkpoints keep you in control and catch issues early.

## What Are Tasks?

A **task** is a unit of work that:
- Takes 1-2 hours to complete
- Has a single, clear acceptance criterion
- Depends on specific other tasks
- Can be reviewed and approved individually

### Task Properties

**Size**: 2-5 minutes
- Too small (>1 minute) = too many micro-tasks
- Too large (30+ minutes) = hard to review, hard to fix if wrong

**Criterion**: Single, testable
- "Write add operation" ✅
- "Write add operation and all tests" ❌ (two things)
- "Write something" ❌ (untestable)

**Independence**: Can be reviewed individually
- Doesn't require other tasks to be done first
- Or clearly depends on specific other tasks

---

## The Checkpoint Pattern (CRITICAL)

This is **the most important concept** in this lesson. The checkpoint pattern is how you maintain control of the workflow.

### Pattern Definition

```
Loop:
  1. Agent: "I've completed Phase X"
  2. Human: "Review the work"
  3. Human: "APPROVE" → Commit to git
  4. Human: "Tell me next step"
```

### Why Checkpoints Matter

**Without Checkpoints** (dangerous):
```
You: "Build my calculator"
Agent: "Done! 5000 lines of code, 47 files. All automated. You're welcome."
You: "Uh... wait, I need to review this..."
Agent: "Too late, already committed and deployed!"
```

**With Checkpoints** (controlled):
```
You: "Start implementation"
Agent: "Phase 1 (Core Operations) complete. 200 lines, ready for review."
You: "Read code... looks good. Commits. What's next?"
Agent: "Phase 2 (Tests) starting"
You: "Review tests... found a bug in edge case handling"
You: "Tell agent, agent fixes, re-reviews, commits"
Agent: "Phase 3..."
```

### Your Role in Each Checkpoint

**Step 1: Human Reviews**
- Read the generated code/tests
- Ask: "Does this match the spec?"
- Ask: "Are there bugs or edge cases missed?"
- Ask: "Is the code understandable?"

**Step 2: Human Decides**
- Approve ("Looks good, commit")
- Reject ("Fix this issue")
- Request clarification ("Explain this code")

**Step 3: Human Directs**
- "What's next?"
- You initiate next phase
- Agent doesn't autonomously continue

## Generating Your Tasks

### Step 1: Run /sp.tasks

In Claude Code, from your calculator-project directory:

```
/sp.tasks

My calculator specification is at specs/calculator/spec.md  
My implementation plan is at specs/calculator/plan.md  

Please decompose the plan into atomic work units (tasks), each ≤ 2 hours,  
testable, reversible, and with clear dependencies.

Use a TDD approach: for each operation (add, subtract, etc.),  
1️⃣ Write RED tests → 2️⃣ Implement → 3️⃣ Refactor.  
Pause after each group for human review before committing.

Also:
- Use Context7 MCP server for documentation lookups.
- Prefer CLI automation where possible.
- Ensure easy rollback and traceability.
```

### Step 2: Review Generated Tasks

The tasks.md should show:
- Task 1: [Description] - 1-2 hours - Depends on: Nothing
- Task 2: [Description] - 1.5 hours - Depends on: Task 1
- Task 3: [Description] - 2 hours - Depends on: Task 1, Task 2
- ...

## Understanding Your Task Breakdown (15 minutes)

Review your tasks and verify:

### Dependency Graph

Here's how your calculator tasks depend on each other:

```
TDD Workflow: 🔴 RED (test) → 🟢 GREEN (implement) → 🔵 REFACTOR/DOCS

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Pattern: Each operation follows RED → GREEN cycle
         Tests MUST exist before implementation
```

**Legend:**
- 🔴 **Red tasks** = Write failing tests first (TDD)
- 🟢 **Green tasks** = Implement code to make tests pass
- 🔵 **Blue tasks** = Documentation and polish

**Key Insight**: Tests MUST exist before implementation. You cannot implement Task 2 (add function) without Task 1 (add tests) being complete. This is the TDD (Test-Driven Development) pattern.

### Lineage Traceability

Pick one task. Can you trace it back?

```
Specification: "Calculator must add two numbers"
  ↓
Plan: "Phase 1: Core Operations - Implement basic arithmetic"
  ↓
Task 1.1: "Implement add(a, b) returning float, handling negative inputs"
  ↓
Acceptance Criterion: "add(5, 3) = 8.0, add(-2, 5) = 3.0, add('5', 3) raises TypeError"
```

If you can trace this lineage, your tasks are well-connected to your specification.

---

## Commit Your Tasks 

Commit the generated tasks to git:

```bash
/sp.git_commit_pr commit the current work in same branch
```

---

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Tasks Too Large (8+ Hours)

**The Error**: "Task: Implement entire calculator (8-16 hours)"

**Why It's Wrong**: Large tasks hide complexity, delay feedback, and make checkpoints meaningless.

**The Fix**: Break into atomic units (1-2 hours each):
- ❌ Large: "Implement all operations"
- ✅ Atomic: "Implement add()" (30 min), "Implement multiply()" (30 min), "Implement divide() with error handling" (1 hour)

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Dependencies

**The Error**: Planning to implement tests before implementing functions

**Why It's Wrong**: Tasks have natural dependencies. Tests depend on functions existing.

**The Fix**: Map dependencies explicitly:
- Task 1: Implement add() → Task 2: Test add() (depends on Task 1)
- Task 3: Implement divide() → Task 4: Test divide() (depends on Task 3)

## Try With AI: Validate Task Breakdown

Use your AI companion to confirm your tasks are well-decomposed and ready for implementation.

### Setup

**Tool**: Claude Code (or your configured AI orchestrator)

**Context**: Your tasks.md file

**Goal**: Confirm tasks are atomic, dependencies are correct, and checkpoint pattern will work

:::tip ⚠️ Learning WITH AI (Not Generating FROM AI)

**What this exercise teaches:**
- ❌ **DON'T ask**: "Implement all these tasks for me"
- ❌ **DON'T ask**: "Write the code for Task 1"
- ✅ **DO ask**: "Are my tasks atomic (1-2 hours each)?"
- ✅ **DO ask**: "Are the dependencies correct?"
- ✅ **DO ask**: "Which tasks could I run in parallel?"

**Your role**: Validate task breakdown, understand dependencies, plan execution strategy
**AI's role**: Review atomicity, validate dependencies, suggest improvements

:::

### Prompt Set (Copy-Paste Ready)

**Prompt 1 - Task Atomicity Check**

Copy and paste this into Claude Code:

```
I've broken my calculator plan into tasks. 

For each task, is it:
1. Atomic? (Does it do one thing with one acceptance criterion?)
2. Sized appropriately? (1-2 hours, not too small or large?)
3. Independent? (Can it be reviewed and tested separately?)

Any tasks that are too big, too small, or trying to do multiple things?
```

**Prompt 2 - Dependency Validation**

After task validation, ask:

```
Looking at my task dependencies, are they correct?

Are these dependencies logical? Would you change the order?
What's the critical path (minimum tasks to complete before "done")?
```

**Prompt 3 - Checkpoint Pattern Understanding**

Finally, ask:

```
I'm about to start the implementation phase, and I want to use the
checkpoint pattern (Agent→Human Review→Commit→Next).
Is this the right approach? Any guidance on what to look for during review?
```

### Expected Outcomes

- **Tasks are atomic and appropriately sized**
- **Dependencies are correct**
- **You understand the checkpoint pattern**
- **Ready for implementation (Lesson 7)**
