# Plan Phase - Architecture Decisions and ADRs

With your specification complete, you now face a new question: How will you actually build it?
This is the essence of the Plan Phase - transforming the ‘What’ of your specification into the ‘How’ of architecture and implementation strategy.

`/sp.plan` generates an implementation plan that breaks your specification into:
- **Architectural components** (core library, error handlers, type system, tests)
- **Implementation phases** (build operations first, then tests, then documentation)
- **Dependencies** (what must be built before what)
- **Design decisions** (which ones matter enough to document)

This lesson teaches you how to work with generated plans and how to capture important architectural decisions using **ADRs (Architectural Decision Records)**.

---

## Understanding the /sp.plan Command

`/sp.plan` analyzes your specification and generates a detailed implementation plan by:

1. **Breaking spec into components** - Which parts of your spec need separate modules?
2. **Ordering dependencies** - What must be built first?
3. **Identifying design decisions** - Where are there multiple valid approaches?
4. **Proposing architecture** - How should code be organized?

**Input**: Your specification (what the calculator must do)

**Output**: Implementation plan with:
- Architecture overview
- Implementation phases
- Component breakdown
- Dependencies and sequencing
- Design decisions highlighted

**The Cascade Effect**: Detailed spec → detailed plan. Vague spec → vague plan.

---

## Generating Your Implementation Plan

Let's generate the plan for your calculator.

### Step 1: Run /sp.plan

In Claude Code, from your calculator-project directory:

```
/sp.plan

Create: architecture sketch, interfaces, data model, error handling, requirements.
Decisions needing: list important choices with options and tradeoffs.
Testing strategy: unit + integration tests based on acceptance criteria.

Technical details:
- Use a simple, functional approach where it makes sense
- Use Python 3.12+ type hints with | union syntax
- Follow TDD: write tests first, then implementation
- Organize code and tests according to your constitution rules
```

**Agent Does:**

- Creates technical implementation plan
- Defines data models and interfaces
- Establishes testing strategy
- Identifies architectural decisions
- Generates quick-start.md and plan.md files

**Why This Matters:**
The plan defines technical architecture for ALL operations at once. This ensures consistency - same type hints, same error handling, same testing approach. Much more efficient than planning each operation separately!

### Step 2: Review Generated Plan

The generated plan should include:

- **Architecture Overview**: How code will be organized (one module? multiple? class-based?)
- **Implementation Phases**: 3-5 phases building from simple to complex
- **Component Breakdown**: Core operations, error handling, type validation, tests, docs
- **Sequencing**: Operations before tests? Validation before operations?
- **Design Decisions**: Where are there choices? (Class vs functions? Exception types? Precision handling?)

---

## Understanding ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) (20 minutes)

Planning exposes **architectural decisions** - choices about how to build that have long-term consequences.

### What Is an ADR?

An **ADR** documents:
- **The Decision**: What choice did you make?
- **The Context**: Why did you need to make this choice?
- **The Alternatives**: What other options existed?
- **The Rationale**: Why did you choose this over alternatives?
- **The Consequences**: What are the long-term impacts?

### When Should You Create an ADR?

**Create an ADR when**:
- The decision has **long-term impact** (affects code structure, not just style)
- **Multiple valid alternatives** existed (not an obvious choice)
- **Future developers will question** the decision
- The decision **constrains future choices** (e.g., choosing a data structure)

**Don't create ADRs for**:
- Style choices (naming conventions, formatting)
- Obvious choices (of course we use Python!)
- Temporary decisions (will revisit in 6 months)
- Out-of-scope decisions (already decided by Constitution)

### Creating ADRs for Your Calculator Plan 

Now let's identify and document the architectural decisions from your calculator plan.

```
/sp.adr review the generate plan and record key Architectural Decisions.
```

It will review the plan and record key architectural decisions in history/adr directory.

---

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Documenting Every Small Decision as ADR

**The Error**: Creating ADRs for trivial choices like "Use snake_case for functions" or "Put tests in tests/ folder"

**Why It's Wrong**: ADRs are for **architecturally significant** decisions (long-term impact, multiple alternatives, future questioning). Trivial choices clutter your ADR history.

**The Fix**: Apply the three-part test:
- Does this have long-term consequences?
- Are there multiple viable alternatives?
- Will someone ask "why did we choose this" in 6 months?

If not all three → Skip the ADR.

### Mistake 2: Vague ADR Consequences

**The Error**: ADR says "This approach is better" without explaining tradeoffs

**Why It's Wrong**: Future developers need to understand **why** you chose this and what you gave up.

**The Fix**: Document both positives and negatives:
- ✅ "Pros: Simpler error handling. Cons: Less precise error messages for users."
- ✅ "Alternatives considered: Exception hierarchy (rejected: overkill for 5 operations)"

## Try With AI: Validate Your Plan and ADRs

Use your AI companion to review your implementation plan and ADRs.

### Setup

**Tool**: Claude Code (or your configured AI orchestrator)

**Context**: Your plan.md and 1-2 ADRs

**Goal**: Confirm plan is sound and ADRs capture key architectural decisions

:::tip ⚠️ Learning WITH AI (Not Generating FROM AI)

**What this exercise teaches:**
- ❌ **DON'T ask**: "Write the implementation code for me"
- ❌ **DON'T ask**: "Generate all the functions"
- ✅ **DO ask**: "Is my plan realistic and well-structured?"
- ✅ **DO ask**: "Do my ADRs capture architecturally significant decisions?"
- ✅ **DO ask**: "What alternatives should I consider for this decision?"

**Your role**: Review plan structure, evaluate ADR quality, make architectural decisions
**AI's role**: Validate plan soundness, suggest improvements, identify missing ADRs

:::

### Prompt Set (Copy-Paste Ready)

**Prompt 1 - Plan Review**

Copy and paste this into Claude Code:

```
I've generated an implementation plan for my calculator.

Looking at my specification, does this plan address all requirements?
Are the phases in the right order? Any missing components?
```

**Prompt 2 - ADR Completeness**

After plan review, ask:

```
I've documented these architectural decisions.

Are these the most important decisions? Did I miss any critical architectural
choices? 
```

**Prompt 3 - Plan to Tasks Readiness**

Finally, ask:

```
Based on my plan and ADRs, am I ready for the Tasks phase?

Tasks will break my plan into atomic work units.
Is my plan detailed enough that tasks will be clear and unambiguous?
```

### Expected Outcomes

- **Plan is sound and complete**
- **ADRs capture key architectural decisions**
- **Specification quality has cascaded into plan and ADR quality**
- **Ready for task breakdown (Lesson 6)**
