4. The Nine Pillar of AI Driven Development (AIDD)

### Part 2: AI Tool Landscape (4 chapters) 
5. How It All Started: The Claude Code Phenomenon
6. Google Gemini CLI: Open Source and Everywhere
7. Bash Essentials for AI-Driven Development
8. Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development

### Part 3: Markdown, Prompt & Context Engineering (3 chapters)
9. Markdown: The Language of AI Communication

## Part 8: TypeScript: The Language of Realtime and Interaction (3 Chapters)

## Part 9: Building Realtime and Voice Agents (3 Chapters)

## Part 10: Containerization & Orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes (3 Chapters)

## Part 11: Data, State, and Memory using PostgreSQL, Graph, and Vector Databases (3 Chapters)

## Part 12: Event-Driven Architecture using Kafka and Dapr (2 Chapters)

## Part 13: Stateful Agents using Dapr Actors and Dapr Workflows (2 Chapters)

Our sequence flows beautifully from “understanding the AI revolution” → “meeting the tools” → “learning to communicate” → “learning to code in Python” → “learning Spec Driven Development methodology” → “build OpenAI Agents in Python” → “build MCP servers” → “learn to code in TypeScript” → “build realtime and voice agents” → “deploy ai agents”
