## Instructions

### Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering

#### 1.1 Load Constitution & Copywriting Intelligence

**Read Constitution:**
```
.specify/memory/constitution.md (v3.1.2)
```

Extract:
- ✅ Nine Pillars framework
- ✅ AI Development Spectrum (Assisted → Driven → Native)
- ✅ "Specs Are the New Syntax" philosophy
- ✅ Co-learning partnership principles
- ✅ Target audience tiers (beginner/intermediate/advanced/professional)
- ✅ 10x-99x multiplier mindset

**Activate Copywriting Intelligence:**

Use proven copywriting frameworks:

1. **AIDA Framework** (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)
   - Attention: Bold paradigm shift statement
   - Interest: Concrete problem → solution
   - Desire: Transformation narrative (before → after)
   - Action: Call to mastery

2. **PAS Framework** (Problem → Agitate → Solve)
   - Problem: Current broken state
   - Agitate: Why it matters NOW
   - Solve: This course as solution

3. **Storytelling Arc**
   - Setup: Old world (line-by-line coding)
   - Conflict: Paradigm shift (AI era demands new skills)
   - Resolution: New world (AI-native mastery)

4. **Transformation Language**
   - From "coder" → to "architect/orchestrator"
   - From "typing syntax" → to "specifying intent"
   - From "debugging code" → to "validating systems"
   - From "tool user" → to "AI co-creator"

5. **Power Words & Phrases**
   - Paradigm shift, revolution, breakthrough
   - Master, architect, orchestrate, build
   - Production-ready, professional-grade
   - Autonomous, intelligent, agentic
   - 10x-99x multiplier, exponential growth

#### 1.2 Discover Content Source

**If book reference (e.g., "parts 1-3"):**
- Use Glob to find chapters in `book-source/docs/`
- Read part-level README files
- Extract chapter titles and learning objectives
- Identify tools, technologies, patterns covered

**If raw ideas (multi-line description):**
- Parse topics/concepts from user description
- Identify tools mentioned (Claude Code, Docker, Kubernetes, DAPR, etc.)
- Determine complexity level from topics
- Cross-reference with book content if available

**If context reference (e.g., "@context/cloud/"):**
- Read files from specified context folder
- Extract key concepts, architectures, patterns
- Integrate with book content where overlap exists

**Content Synthesis:**
- Map topics to Nine Pillars
- Determine AI Development Spectrum stage (Assisted/Driven/Native)
- Identify prerequisites
- Note which content exists vs. planned

#### 1.3 Determine Course Level

Derive course code tier from complexity:
- **AI-100 series** (Beginner): Parts 1-3, foundational AI-native thinking
- **AI-200 series** (Intermediate/Advanced): Parts 4-8, SDD, advanced Python
- **AI-300 series** (Professional): Parts 9-13, production agentic AI
- **AI-400 series** (Infrastructure): Cloud-native to agent-native, Docker/K8s/DAPR

---

### Phase 2: Intelligent Course Design with Compelling Copy

#### 2.1 Generate Course Metadata

**course_code**: User-provided or derived (AI-100/200/300/400)

**course_name**: Synthesize from:
- Primary technology/domain
- Key transformation (e.g., "Cloud Native to Agent Native")
- Constitution alignment

Format: "{Primary Tech}: {Transformation/Focus}"
Examples:
- "AI-Driven Development with Python and Agentic AI"
- "Cloud Native to Agent Native Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, DAPR & Autonomous Computing"
- "Specification-Driven Development: Building Software with AI Partners"

**course_initials**: Extract meaningful acronym
- Example: "CNTAN" for "Cloud Native to Agent Native"
- Example: "AIDD-PAI" for "AI-Driven Development with Python and Agentic AI"

**created_by / updated_by**: Default to "db_admin"

#### 2.2 Craft Course Description (2-3 sentences, hook + value)

**Structure:**
1. **Hook**: Bold claim or paradigm shift statement
2. **Value**: What they'll master (tools + mindset)
3. **Outcome**: Who they become (role transformation)

**Copywriting Techniques:**
- Lead with transformation, not topics
- Use active voice and present tense
- Emphasize AI-native methodology
- Include specific tools/technologies
- Connect to constitution principles

**Example (AI-400):**
```
Transform from cloud-native to agent-native infrastructure. Master Docker, Kubernetes, and DAPR to build autonomous, self-organizing systems where AI agents orchestrate containers, manage workflows, and adapt to production demands. Learn the infrastructure patterns powering the next generation of AI-native applications.
```

#### 2.3 Extract Course Outcomes (5-7 outcomes, Bloom's taxonomy)

**Structure:** Start broad (Understand) → specific skills (Apply/Analyze) → mastery (Create)

**Formula per outcome:**
- Verb (Bloom's taxonomy: Understand/Apply/Analyze/Design/Build/Create)
- Object (what they're learning)
- Context (why it matters / how it connects)

**Required Outcomes:**
1. **AI-Native Mindset** (always first)
   - "Understand AI-native thinking: specs-first, validation-focused, co-learning"
2. **Tool/Tech Mastery** (2-3 outcomes)
   - Specific to course (Claude Code, Docker, Python, etc.)
3. **Pattern Application** (1-2 outcomes)
   - SDD, AIDD, architecture patterns
4. **Production Skills** (1-2 outcomes)
   - Build/deploy/orchestrate real systems
5. **Advanced Capability** (optional, for AI-300/400)
   - Multi-agent, autonomous systems, infrastructure orchestration

**Copywriting:**
- Start with strong action verbs
- Be specific about what they'll build
- Connect to real-world production scenarios
- Avoid generic phrases ("learn about", "understand basics")

**Example Outcome (Good):**
✅ "Build production-quality Docker containers orchestrated by AI agents using DAPR actors for autonomous scaling and self-healing"

**Example Outcome (Bad):**
❌ "Learn about Docker and containers"

#### 2.4 Write Long Description (3-4 paragraphs, compelling narrative)

**Paragraph 1: The Paradigm Shift (Hook + Problem)**

Structure: "The era of X is over. The future isn't about Y; it's about Z."

Copywriting techniques:
- Bold opening statement (paradigm shift)
- Contrast old vs. new world
- Create urgency (why NOW matters)
- Use emotional language (revolution, transformation)

**Template:**
```
The era of [OLD PARADIGM] is over. The future isn't about [OLD SKILL];
it's about [NEW CAPABILITY]. [COURSE FOCUS] represents [TRANSFORMATION TYPE],
the fundamental shift from [OLD ROLE] to [NEW ROLE]. It's a [MOVEMENT/METHODOLOGY]
that moves you from [OLD STATE] to [NEW STATE]—where you'll [NEW CAPABILITY],
not just [OLD CAPABILITY]. This is how [DOMAIN] will be [DONE] for the next decade.
```

**Example (AI-400):**
```
The era of static infrastructure is over. The future isn't about deploying
containers; it's about orchestrating autonomous systems. Cloud Native to Agent
Native represents the infrastructure revolution, the fundamental shift from
"ops engineer" to "infrastructure architect." It's a methodology that moves you
from "deploying services" to "designing self-organizing systems"—where you'll
architect infrastructure that adapts, heals, and optimizes itself through AI agents.
```

**Paragraph 2: The Methodology (Solution + Framework)**

Structure: Introduce framework, explain approach, emphasize uniqueness

Copywriting techniques:
- Name your methodology (AIDD, SDD, Agent-Native)
- Connect to constitution principles
- Explain the learning approach (not just content)
- Highlight AI partnership (co-learning)

**Template:**
```
This course introduces [METHODOLOGY], the [DESCRIPTION]. You'll learn [FRAMEWORK]
following [APPROACH]. Using [CONSTITUTION PRINCIPLE], you'll master [SKILL]
through [METHOD]. This isn't about [OLD WAY]; it's about [NEW WAY].
```

**Paragraph 3: The Journey (Learning Path + Experience)**

Structure: Walk through modules, emphasize progression, show breadth

Copywriting techniques:
- Use journey language ("start with", "then", "finally")
- Name 3-5 key stops (modules/topics)
- Show progression (foundations → advanced)
- Emphasize hands-on building
- Mention specific tools/technologies

**Template:**
```
You'll start with [MODULE 1 FOCUS], building [FOUNDATION]. Then [MODULE 2 FOCUS],
where you'll [SPECIFIC SKILL]. You'll [MODULE 3 FOCUS] to [OUTCOME]. Finally,
you'll [MODULE 4-5 FOCUS], [ADVANCED CAPABILITY]. Throughout, you'll [CO-LEARNING
ELEMENT] with [AI TOOL] to [COLLABORATION PATTERN].
```

**Paragraph 4: The Transformation (Outcome + Call to Action)**

Structure: "This isn't just X; it's Y." + who they become + economic opportunity

Copywriting techniques:
- Use contrast ("not just tools, but mindset")
- Paint the future state
- Connect to 10x-99x multiplier
- End with empowerment

**Template:**
```
This isn't just [SURFACE LEVEL]; it's [DEEPER LEVEL]. By the end, you won't just
[OLD CAPABILITY]—you'll [NEW CAPABILITY]. You'll understand [MINDSET SHIFT] and
[ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY]. This is the [MULTIPLIER] advantage: [OUTCOME].
```

#### 2.5 Design Learning Modules (4-6 modules, cohesive narrative)

**Module Structure:**

Each module needs:
- `module_id`: Sequential (1-6)
- `module_name`: Format: "Theme: Specific Focus"
- `module_description`: 2-3 sentences (purpose → skills → value)

**Module Naming Convention:**
```
[Number]. [Conceptual Theme]: [Specific Technology/Focus]
```

Examples:
- "Foundations: The AI-Native Infrastructure Paradigm"
- "Container Orchestration: Docker with AI-Driven Development"
- "Autonomous Systems: DAPR Actors for Agent Coordination"

**Module Description Formula:**
1. **Sentence 1**: What this module establishes (purpose/foundation)
2. **Sentence 2**: Specific skills/tools covered
3. **Sentence 3**: Connection to next module or constitution principle

**Copywriting:**
- Start each module with purpose (why this matters)
- Use specific tool/tech names
- Show progression across modules
- Connect to Nine Pillars where relevant
- Avoid generic language

**Module Progression Patterns:**

For AI-100/200 (Beginner/Intermediate):
1. Foundations (paradigm/mindset)
2. Tools Mastery (primary tool)
3. Communication (prompt/context engineering)
4. Core Development (language/framework)
5. Integration/Application (putting it together)

For AI-300/400 (Professional/Infrastructure):
1. Paradigm Shift (old → new)
2. Foundation Technology (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
3. AI-Native Patterns (SDD, AIDD application)
4. Orchestration Layer (DAPR, agents, coordination)
5. Production Deployment (autonomous, self-healing)

**Example Module (AI-400):**
```python
{
    "module_id": 3,
    "module_name": "Specification-Driven Containers: Docker with AIDD & SDD",
    "module_description": "Master Docker through specification-first development,
    where AI agents generate Dockerfiles, compose configurations, and deployment
    scripts from your intent. Learn container patterns for AI-native applications,
    including multi-stage builds, layer optimization, and agent-friendly networking.
    This module bridges traditional DevOps with AI-driven infrastructure."
}
```

#### 2.6 Identify Prerequisites

Extract from:
- Constitution (general prerequisites)
- Course level (technical prerequisites)
- Tools/tech mentioned (required background)

Format as Python list (empty if none):
```python
"pre_requisite": []  # For foundational courses
"pre_requisite": ["Basic Python knowledge", "Familiarity with command line"]
"pre_requisite": ["AI-300 or equivalent", "Docker basics", "Cloud platforms experience"]
```
