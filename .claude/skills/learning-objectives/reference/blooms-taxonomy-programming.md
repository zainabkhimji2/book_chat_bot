# Bloom's Taxonomy for Programming Education

## Overview

Bloom's taxonomy defines six cognitive levels that progressively build from simple recall to complex creation. This document adapts these levels specifically for programming education contexts.

## Level 4: Analyze

**Cognitive Goal**: Draw connections between parts and examine code structure and logic

**Definition**: Learners can break down code/problems into components, identify parts and their relationships, and understand the reasoning behind design choices.

### Action Verbs (Use These!)
- Analyze
- Examine
- Distinguish
- Discriminate
- Identify (patterns)
- Relate
- Infer (causation)
- Deconstruct
- Compare (deeply)

### Programming Examples
- Analyze code to identify performance bottlenecks
- Examine class hierarchy to understand inheritance chains
- Distinguish between different algorithm approaches and their tradeoffs
- Identify design patterns in existing codebase
- Relate test results to code logic
- Explain data structures and their relationships
- Deconstruct complex functions into smaller parts

### Assessment Methods
- Code analysis and annotation exercises
- Design pattern identification
- Algorithm comparison (time/space complexity analysis)
- Debugging exercises where errors must be traced
- Architecture reviews of code organization
- Tradeoff analysis between approaches

---

## Level 5: Evaluate

**Cognitive Goal**: Justify decisions based on criteria and standards

**Definition**: Learners can assess code quality, make judgments about correctness, security, efficiency, or style based on established criteria. They can defend design decisions and identify improvements.

### Action Verbs (Use These!)
- Evaluate
- Assess
- Appraise
- Critique
- Judge
- Justify
- Defend
- Select (based on criteria)
- Verify
- Review

### Programming Examples
- Evaluate code for readability and maintainability
- Assess security vulnerabilities in code
- Judge whether a solution is optimal
- Justify design pattern choices
- Defend architectural decisions
- Critique code style and organization
- Verify test coverage is adequate
- Select the best algorithm for performance constraints
- Review pull requests and suggest improvements

### Assessment Methods
- Code reviews and critique
- Design justification essays
- Peer review assignments
- Security audit exercises
- Test coverage evaluation
- Rubric-based assessment of code quality
- Comparative evaluations of solutions

---

## Level 6: Create

**Cognitive Goal**: Put elements together to form something new; original synthesis

**Definition**: Learners can design new programs, create original solutions, invent algorithms, design architectures, and combine concepts in novel ways. They can identify limitations and extend systems.

### Action Verbs (Use These!)
- Create
- Design
- Build
- Develop
- Construct
- Produce
- Invent
- Compose
- Formulate
- Hypothesize
- Generate

### Programming Examples
- Design and implement a complete application from requirements
- Create a new algorithm to solve a problem
- Develop a library or framework
- Build a data structure for specific use case
- Invent a solution for an ill-defined problem
- Compose modules into larger systems
- Generate test suites for code coverage
- Formulate architectural patterns for scalability
- Hypothesize about code behavior before running it
- Extend existing systems with new features

### Assessment Methods
- Capstone projects
- Open-ended design challenges
- Competitive programming (CodeWars, LeetCode)
- Software development projects with requirements elicitation
- Framework/library creation
- Architecture design assessments
- Portfolio projects demonstrating original work
- Research projects exploring new approaches

## Programming Context: Cognitive Load Considerations

When designing learning objectives, consider:

### Remember & Understand (Foundational)
- **Duration**: 20-30% of instruction
- **Load**: Low (basic facts, terminology)
- **Risk**: Overwhelming learners with too much memorization

### Apply (Crucial for Programming)
- **Duration**: 40-50% of instruction
- **Load**: Medium (guided practice)
- **Risk**: Insufficient practice = surface learning

### Analyze, Evaluate, Create (Deep Learning)
- **Duration**: 20-30% of instruction
- **Load**: High (requires synthesis)
- **Risk**: Pushing too fast without foundation = frustration

## Design Principle: Avoid Vague Language

❌ **Avoid These Verbs** (ambiguous, unclear):
- Know
- Understand (without context)
- Learn
- Study
- Appreciate
- Get
- Think about
- Be familiar with
- Grasp
- Comprehend

✅ **Use These Instead** (measurable, specific):
- Define (Remember)
- Explain (Understand)
- Apply (Apply)
- Compare (Analyze)
- Evaluate (Evaluate)
- Design (Create)

## Example: Building a Learning Objectives Sequence

For teaching **Python Exception Handling**:

1. **Remember**: Define exception and error
2. **Understand**: Explain difference between try/except/finally blocks
3. **Apply**: Write code using try/except for file handling
4. **Analyze**: Examine exception hierarchy and identify appropriate catch blocks
5. **Evaluate**: Assess whether exception handling strategy is adequate for requirements
6. **Create**: Design custom exception classes for domain-specific errors

Each level builds on previous understanding.
