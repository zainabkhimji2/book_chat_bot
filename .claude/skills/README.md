# CoLearning Python Skills

This directory contains specialized pedagogical skills for creating high-quality Python programming education content. These skills are designed to be **semantically activated** based on the educator's intent and teaching needs, using Claude Code's natural language understanding.


## Architecture: Progressive Disclosure

The skills follow a **progressive disclosure architecture** with three layers:

### Layer 1: Skill Description (SKILL.md frontmatter)
Each skill's description in SKILL.md provides a concise overview that Claude uses for semantic activation. When an educator's request matches the skill's purpose, Claude automatically activates the appropriate skill.

### Layer 2: Process and Guidance (SKILL.md body)
Once activated, the skill provides step-by-step guidance, explaining:
- When to use the skill
- What inputs are required
- How to execute the process
- What outputs to generate
- Common patterns and troubleshooting

### Layer 3: Deep Reference Materials
For complex concepts, skills reference detailed documents:
- `reference/`: In-depth guides on pedagogical theories, strategies, and patterns
- `templates/`: Structured formats for outputs (YAML, Markdown)
- `scripts/`: Validation and assessment utilities

This layered approach ensures Claude can:
1. **Quickly determine relevance** (Layer 1 descriptions)
2. **Execute effectively** (Layer 2 processes)
3. **Apply rigor** (Layer 3 references and validation)

## How Skills Are Activated

Skills are **semantically activated** based on the intent and context of your request. You don't need to explicitly invoke a skill name - Claude understands your pedagogical goal and activates the appropriate skill automatically.

### Activation Factors

1. **Intent Keywords**: Words like "objectives", "scaffold", "examples", "exercises", "assessment", "clarity", "structure", "AI integration"

2. **Task Context**: What you're trying to accomplish (planning, creating, reviewing, validating)

3. **Teaching Stage**: Curriculum design, content creation, quality review, or student support

4. **Pedagogical Concerns**: Cognitive load, measurability, accessibility, evidence-based strategies

### Example Activation Patterns

**Request**: "I need to teach Python decorators to intermediate learners. How should I structure this?"

**Skills Activated**:
1. `concept-scaffolding` (primary) - Breaks down complex concept into steps
2. `learning-objectives` (supporting) - Defines what students should achieve
3. `code-example-generator` (supporting) - Creates demonstration examples

---

**Request**: "Create a quiz for my functions lesson that tests understanding, not just memorization."

**Skills Activated**:
1. `assessment-builder` (primary) - Creates balanced assessment
2. `learning-objectives` (supporting) - Aligns questions to objectives

---

**Request**: "Is this tutorial clear for beginners? I'm worried about jargon."

**Skills Activated**:
1. `technical-clarity` (primary) - Reviews readability and accessibility

---

**Request**: "Design practice exercises for loops that also review conditionals from last week."

**Skills Activated**:
1. `exercise-designer` (primary) - Creates exercises with spaced repetition

---

## Usage Principles

### 1. Skills Are Complementary
Multiple skills often work together. For example, after generating learning objectives, you might:
- Use `concept-scaffolding` to break down complex objectives
- Use `code-example-generator` to create demonstrations
- Use `exercise-designer` to create practice activities
- Use `assessment-builder` to measure achievement

### 2. Progressive Workflow
Skills support a natural teaching workflow:
1. **Plan**: `learning-objectives`, `book-architecture`
2. **Create**: `concept-scaffolding`, `code-example-generator`, `exercise-designer`
3. **Assess**: `assessment-builder`
4. **Review**: `technical-clarity`
5. **Integrate AI**: `ai-augmented-teaching`

### 3. Validation and Iteration
Most skills include validation scripts in their `scripts/` directories. Use these to:
- Check quality objectively
- Identify specific improvements
- Ensure standards are met

### 4. Reference Materials
Each skill's `reference/` directory contains deep pedagogical knowledge:
- Bloom's Taxonomy for programming
- Cognitive Load Theory
- Evidence-based learning strategies
- Best practices and patterns

You don't need to read these directly - skills reference them automatically when needed. But they're available if you want to understand the underlying pedagogy.

## Pedagogical Foundations

These skills are grounded in evidence-based teaching research:

- **Bloom's Taxonomy**: Cognitive levels from Remember to Create
- **Cognitive Load Theory**: Managing working memory limitations
- **Deliberate Practice**: Structured, purposeful skill development
- **Retrieval Practice**: Strengthening memory through recall
- **Spaced Repetition**: Distributing practice over time
- **Interleaving**: Mixing concepts to improve transfer
- **Worked Examples**: Demonstrating problem-solving processes
- **Scaffolding**: Progressive support reduction
- **Constructive Alignment**: Aligning objectives, activities, and assessment

## Quality Standards

All skills enforce quality through validation:

- **Measurability**: Objectives use action verbs and success criteria
- **Cognitive Balance**: Assessments test application, not just recall (60%+ non-recall)
- **Accessibility**: Content readability matches target audience
- **Evidence-Based**: Exercises apply cognitive science principles
- **Completeness**: Content includes prerequisites, examples, context
- **Runnable Code**: Examples are syntactically correct and executable
- **Ethical AI Use**: AI integration balances assistance with learning
