## Purpose

Generate high-quality, college-level MCQ quizzes (50 comprehensive questions total) using the globally-registered Quiz component (`<Quiz />`). The component automatically:
- Displays 15-20 random questions per session (shuffled from the 50 total)
- Shows immediate feedback after each answer (correct option + explanation + why wrong if incorrect)
- Shuffles questions differently on each retake (randomized batching from the same 50)
- Provides progress tracking, color-coded feedback, and detailed review page
- NO passing/failing threshold—just tracks score and learning

**Output is ALWAYS a Quiz component with 50 questions, NEVER static markdown quizzes.**

**Core Principles:**
- Test understanding and application, not memorization
- **50 comprehensive questions** ensures thorough chapter coverage
- **Immediate feedback per question** enables real-time learning (not delayed until results page)
- **Randomized batching** (15-20 per session) keeps students engaged across multiple attempts
- Provide meaningful explanations addressing all misconceptions
- **No pass/fail threshold**—focus on learning, not grading

## When to Activate

This skill should be used when creating end-of-chapter assessments. **CRITICAL: This skill ALWAYS generates interactive quizzes using the Quiz component—NEVER static markdown quizzes. ALWAYS 50 QUESTIONS TOTAL.**

Activate this skill when:
- Creating end-of-chapter assessments that MUST use the Quiz component
- Need college-level conceptual questions (50 comprehensive questions total)
- Want interactive quiz with immediate feedback per question (not delayed until results)
- Want randomized batch display (15-20 questions per session, different batches on retake)
- Want instant explanations showing correct option AND why wrong answers are incorrect
- Need fully responsive, accessible quiz with light/dark theme support
- Creating MDX-compatible quiz files using `<Quiz />` component

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Create a quiz for Chapter X"
- "Generate a 50-question quiz for Chapter X"
- "Build an interactive quiz with immediate feedback"
- "Create chapter assessment with randomized batching"
- "Generate college-level assessment with 50 questions"

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Use Quiz component (NEVER static markdown)
2. Generate 50 total questions (comprehensive chapter coverage)
3. Component displays 15-20 per batch (randomized each retake)
4. Randomize correctOption indices evenly across 0-3
5. Explanations MUST address why wrong answers are incorrect
6. NO passing score threshold—just score tracking
7. Immediate feedback shown after each answer
8. **🚨 CRITICAL: ALL options within ±3 words of each other per question** (prevents test-takers from guessing by selecting longest/shortest option)
9. **🚨 MANDATORY VALIDATION: Manually count words for EVERY option in EVERY question (all 50 questions)** before submitting quiz
10. **🚨 CRITICAL: Verify correct answer is NOT correlated with option length** (longest option must NOT be more frequently correct)

## Key Concepts

### College-Level Conceptual Questions

**Shift from Recall to Understanding:**

❌ **Recall (Avoid):**
> "What is a Python list?" → Tests memorization

✅ **Conceptual (Target):**
> "Given this code with list operations, what misconception does this error reveal?" → Tests understanding

**Why College-Level?**
1. Job readiness: Professional developers need to understand WHY, not just WHAT
2. AI-era skills: With AI generating code, understanding concepts matters more than syntax recall
3. Transfer learning: Conceptual knowledge transfers; memorized facts don't
4. Better assessment: Conceptual questions predict programming competence

**Cognitive Level Target:**
- 75%+ questions at Apply level or higher
- Focus on debugging, prediction, analysis (not recall)

---

### Immediate Feedback Learning Model

**Quiz component shows feedback IMMEDIATELY after each answer** (not delayed until results page). This enables:

1. **Real-time learning:** Students learn from mistakes instantly, not after quiz completion
2. **Deeper engagement:** Immediate reinforcement = higher retention
3. **Misconception correction:** Explain WHY their wrong answer was incorrect right away
4. **Better explanations:** Space for 100-200 word explanations per question (comprehensive, not rushed)

**Feedback shows:**
- ✅ **Correct answer highlight** (green background on correct option)
- ✅ **Why your answer was wrong** (if incorrect: "You selected X, but this is incorrect because...")
- ✅ **Correct option named** (The correct answer is: Y)
- ✅ **Full explanation** (80-150 words explaining concept, addressing misconceptions, real-world connection)

**Example feedback structure:**
```
✓ CORRECT!
[Explanation of why this is right...]

vs.

✗ INCORRECT
Why your answer was wrong:
You selected: "append() is immutable"
This is incorrect. The correct answer is: "append() modifies the list in place"

Explanation:
Lists are mutable (changeable) in Python. The append() method modifies the original list
in place and returns None (doesn't return a new list). This is different from strings,
which are immutable. Understanding mutability is crucial for debugging...
```

---

### 50-Question Bank with Randomized Batching

**Why 50 questions?**
- **Comprehensive coverage:** 50 questions ensure all chapter concepts are thoroughly tested
- **Spaced repetition:** Student can take quiz multiple times, seeing different questions each time
- **Long-term retention:** 50 unique questions = better recall than 15-20 repeated questions

**How batching works:**
1. You provide all 50 questions to the Quiz component
2. Component shuffles all 50 on mount
3. Component displays questions 1-15 (or 1-20) for user to answer
4. User completes batch, sees results page
5. User clicks "Try Another Batch" → Component reshuffles all 50
6. Component displays a NEW random batch of 15-20 (completely different questions)

**Example flow:**
```
Session 1: User sees questions [3, 47, 12, 28, 5, 11, ...] (15-20 questions)
Completes, sees results: 14/18 correct

User clicks "Try Another Batch" →

Session 2: User sees questions [42, 8, 31, 1, 19, 35, ...] (15-20 DIFFERENT questions)
Takes quiz again: 16/19 correct

Session 3: User clicks "Try Another Batch" →

Component shows completely DIFFERENT shuffle: [25, 9, 48, 2, 18, ...]
```

---

### Option Length Validation (CRITICAL - Test Validity)

**THE PROBLEM:** Options of unequal length allow test-takers to guess correctly without reading questions. Example:
- ❌ "Yes" (2 words) vs. "Organizational capabilities create guardrails preventing failures" (6 words) → Students select longest without reading
- ❌ Longest option is correct 80% of the time → Test measures reading strategy, not understanding

**THE SOLUTION:** **ALL options within ±3 words of each other** across all 50 questions.

**Validation Procedure (MANDATORY):**

1. **Count words for EVERY option in EVERY question** (all 50 questions):
   ```
   Question: "Why is X important?"
   A: "It improves performance quickly" (4 words)
   B: "It simplifies code structure" (4 words)
   C: "It prevents common bugs" (4 words)
   D: "It helps developers work together" (5 words) ✓ All within ±3 range (4-5 is acceptable)
   ```

2. **Flag any question failing the ±3 word rule:**
   ```
   ❌ FAIL:
   A: "Yes" (2 words)
   B: "The framework processes requests asynchronously in a single event loop without blocking" (12 words)
   → Difference: 10 words → FAIL (>3 word difference)

   ✅ PASS:
   A: "AI amplifies existing practices" (4 words)
   B: "AI fixes all problems" (4 words)
   C: "AI changes developer roles" (4 words)
   D: "AI prevents errors completely" (4 words)
   → All within 4-4 range → PASS
   ```

3. **Verify length distribution** (no correlation with correctness):
   - Count how many correct answers are in longest option group
   - Count how many correct answers are in shortest option group
   - Should be roughly equal (not "longest is always correct")

4. **Document validation in handoff:**
   ```
   Option Length Validation Complete:
   ✓ All 50 questions checked
   ✓ All options within ±3 word range
   ✓ No length-correctness correlation
   ✓ Longest option correct in 6 questions
   ✓ Shortest option correct in 7 questions
   ✓ Middle-length correct in 12 questions
   ```

**Why ±3 words matters:**
- 4-5 words: Similar cognitive load, hard to distinguish by scanning
- 10+ word difference: Readers start pattern-matching (always pick longest/shortest)
- ±3 rule: Prevents strategic test-taking without reading

📖 **Reference:** [option-length-validation.md](./references/option-length-validation.md) for detailed examples and verification scripts

---

### Answer Randomization with Quiz Component

**Requirements:**
- Correct answers distributed across 0-3 indices (not a/b/c/d)
- For 50 questions: ~12-13 per index (25% each)
- No obvious patterns
- Maximum 2 consecutive same answers

**Quiz Component Format:**
```javascript
{
  question: "Your question?",
  options: ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
  correctOption: 2,  // Index 0-3, NOT 1-4!
  explanation: "Why this is correct AND why other options are wrong..."
}
```

**How to Randomize (for 50 questions):**
1. Write all 50 questions first (don't worry about correctOption distribution)
2. After ALL questions written, shuffle correctOption values across all questions
3. Verify distribution: aim for ~12-13 questions per index (0,1,2,3)
4. Ensure no 3+ consecutive same correctOption values
5. Spot-check: visually verify longest sequence is ≤2 same indices

📖 **Reference:** [answer-distribution.md](./references/answer-distribution.md) for verification methods

---

### Explanation Quality (Critical for Immediate Feedback)

**Quiz component shows explanations immediately after each answer.** Comprehensive explanations enable deeper learning:

**Good Explanations (100-150 words):**
1. **Explain WHY correct** (2-3 sentences)
2. **Address why EACH distractor is wrong** (1-2 sentences each × 3 distractors = 6-8 sentences)
3. **Add context/examples** (real-world connection, misconception clarification)

**Example:**
```javascript
explanation: "Lists are mutable (changeable) in Python, so append() modifies the original
list in place. This is different from strings, which are immutable—you can't change them
after creation. The extend() method adds multiple items (like appending a list), but
append() adds a single item. Insert() requires both value and position. Understanding
mutability is crucial for debugging variable scope issues and understanding function
side effects. When a function calls append() on a list parameter, it modifies the
original list outside the function—a common source of bugs."
```

---

### Source Field (Lesson Attribution)

**The `source` field links each question to the specific lesson it addresses.** This helps students know which lesson material to review.

**Format:** `"Lesson N: [Lesson Title]"`

**Source Extraction:**
- Extract lesson number from lesson file name (01, 02, 03, etc.)
- Extract lesson title from lesson .md file's title metadata (the `title:` field in YAML frontmatter)
- Quiz is already chapter-specific, so chapter info is redundant

**Examples:**
```javascript
source: "Lesson 1: Understanding Mutability"
source: "Lesson 3: Scope and Closures"
source: "Lesson 2: Unit Test Design"
```

**Display in Feedback:**
- Appears in the feedback section after explanation
- Format: "Source: Lesson 1: Understanding Mutability"
- Italic styling with subtle border separator
- Helps students quickly navigate to the relevant lesson if they want to review

## Quiz Architecture

### Fixed Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

```yaml
question_count: 50  # Comprehensive bank (50 total questions)
questions_per_batch: 15-20  # Questions displayed per session (component shuffles)
options_per_question: 4  # Always exactly 4 options
question_format: multiple_choice  # Only MCQ
correct_answer_distribution: random_equal  # indices 0-3 equally distributed (~12-13 per index)
feedback_timing: immediate  # Shown after each answer (not delayed)
passing_score: NONE  # No pass/fail threshold—just score tracking
file_naming: ##_chapter_##_quiz.md  # e.g., 05_chapter_02_quiz.md
output_format: Markdown with Quiz component  # <Quiz {...} questions={[...50 questions...]} />
component_globally_registered: true  # No imports needed
```

**CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERNS:**
- ❌ **Fewer than 50 questions** (comprehensive coverage requires full 50)
- ❌ **Pass/fail threshold** (remove passingScore prop entirely)
- ❌ Using array indices 1-4 (use 0-3!)
- ❌ Questions that test recall instead of understanding
- ❌ Explanations NOT addressing why EACH distractor is wrong
- ❌ No randomization of correctOption values across 50 questions
- ❌ Incomplete explanations (must be 100-150 words addressing all options)
- ❌ File naming like `##_quiz.md` (use `##_chapter_##_quiz.md`)

## Common Pitfalls (Top 7)

1. **Fewer than 50 Questions (CRITICAL):** Only generating 15-20 questions
   - ❌ "Only generated 30 questions" → Doesn't provide comprehensive coverage
   - ✅ Generate all 50 questions → Component handles batching automatically
   - Fix: **Always write 50 questions. Component displays 15-20 per session automatically.**

2. **Index Confusion (CRITICAL):** Using correctOption: 1-4 instead of 0-3
   - ❌ `correctOption: 4` → References non-existent 5th option
   - ✅ `correctOption: 3` → Correct (last option, 4th item)
   - Fix: Always use 0-3 indices

3. **Missing Source Field (CRITICAL):** Not including `source` field for questions
   - ❌ No `source` field → Students don't know which lesson the question addresses
   - ✅ All 50 questions have `source: "Lesson N: [Lesson Title]"`
   - Fix: Extract lesson number and title from lesson .md file metadata and populate source field for every question

4. **Including Passing Score:** Adding `passingScore` prop
   - ❌ `<Quiz ... passingScore={70} />` → No pass/fail in new version
   - ✅ `<Quiz ... />` → Just score tracking, no threshold
   - Fix: Remove passingScore entirely—focus on learning, not grading

5. **Testing Recall:** "What is X?" questions → Memorization
   - ❌ "What is a Python list?"
   - ✅ "Which operation modifies a list in-place and what is its return value?"
   - Fix: Focus on Apply/Analyze/Evaluate levels

6. **Weak Distractors or Incomplete Explanations:** Not addressing why each option is right/wrong
   - ❌ "Lists are mutable." (only explains correct answer)
   - ❌ "Lists are mutable; strings aren't." (misses all 3 distractors)
   - ✅ Full 100-150 word explanation addressing all 4 options explicitly
   - Fix: Write comprehensive explanations explaining why each of the 3 wrong options is incorrect

7. **Answer Patterns:** Obvious distribution patterns in correctOption across 50 questions
   - ❌ First 25 questions all have correctOption 0-1, last 25 all have 2-3
   - ❌ correctOption sequence: 0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3... (repeating pattern)
   - ✅ Evenly distributed: ~12-13 per index, random order
   - Fix: Shuffle correctOption values across all 50; verify equal distribution

8. **Option Length Bias (🚨 CRITICAL - TEST VALIDITY THREAT):** Options of unequal length allow test-takers to achieve 60-70%+ accuracy by selecting longest/shortest option WITHOUT reading questions

   **Impact:** Unequal lengths undermine the entire quiz's validity. Student might appear to understand when they're just following a pattern.

   **Examples:**
   - ❌ **INVALID:** A: "Yes" (2 words), B: "The framework processes requests asynchronously in a single event loop" (11 words), C: "No" (2 words), D: "Maybe" (5 words)
     - Difference: 2 to 11 words = 9-word spread → FAIL
     - Students can select B (longest) and get questions correct without reading

   - ❌ **INVALID:** Longest option is correct in 35 out of 50 questions (70%)
     - This creates systematic bias toward selecting longest option
     - Even if individual questions pass ±3 rule, overall pattern fails

   - ✅ **VALID:** All options 4-5 words: "AI amplifies existing practices" (4 words), "AI fixes broken processes" (4 words), "AI prevents all errors" (4 words), "AI changes developer skill" (5 words)
     - Difference: 4 to 5 words = 1-word spread → PASS
     - Correct answer distributed (longest correct in 2 questions, middle in 3, shortest in 1)

   **Fix (MANDATORY):**
   1. **Count words for ALL 50 questions** (not spot-check, all of them)
   2. **Enforce ±3 word limit strictly** (4, 5, 6, 7 words = PASS; 3, 6, 9 = FAIL)
   3. **Verify no length-correctness correlation** (correct answer sometimes longest, sometimes shortest, mostly middle)
   4. **Document validation results** before handoff

   **Validation Checklist:**
   - [ ] All 50 questions checked for word count
   - [ ] All options within ±3 word range
   - [ ] Longest option correct in ~25% of questions (distributed, not biased)
   - [ ] Shortest option correct in ~25% of questions (distributed, not biased)
   - [ ] No pattern visible (not "always pick longest or shortest")

## File Naming Convention

### Pattern: `##_chapter_##_quiz.md`

Where:
- First `##` = sidebar_position (lesson count + 1)
- Second `##` = chapter number (zero-padded)
- Extension: `.md` (Quiz component is globally registered, no imports needed)

**Examples:**
- Chapter 2 (4 lessons): `05_chapter_02_quiz.md`
- Chapter 5 (6 lessons): `07_chapter_05_quiz.md`
- Chapter 14 (5 lessons): `06_chapter_14_quiz.md`

**Why this naming:**
- Matches lesson naming convention
- Clear chapter identification
- `.md` extension (Quiz component handles JSX rendering in markdown)
- Natural sorting places quiz at chapter end
- File contains 50 questions (component handles batching)

📖 **Reference:** [file-naming.md](./references/file-naming.md) for complete guidance

**Quiz Generator v4.0.0 ALWAYS creates interactive assessments using the globally-registered Quiz component with 50 COMPREHENSIVE QUESTIONS. NEVER creates static markdown quizzes or fewer than 50 questions. Component automatically displays 15-20 random questions per batch, shuffled differently on each retake. Features immediate feedback per question (correct option + explanation + why wrong if incorrect), no passing/failing threshold (just score tracking), progress tracking, answer validation, color-coded feedback, retake button, and full theme support.

Every quiz MUST:
- Use <Quiz /> component with 50 questions
- Have randomized correctOption indices (0-3) evenly distributed
- Include 100-150 word explanations addressing all 4 options
- Include source field for all questions (format: "Lesson N: [Lesson Title]")
- **ENFORCE STRICT OPTION LENGTH VALIDATION: ALL options within ±3 words of each other for ALL 50 questions** (manually verified, not assumed)
- **VERIFY no correlation between option length and correctness** (longest option NOT biased toward being correct)
- NO passingScore prop
- NO passing/failing threshold**
