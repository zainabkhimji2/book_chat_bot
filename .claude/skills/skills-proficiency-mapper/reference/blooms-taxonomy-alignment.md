## The Six Cognitive Levels (2001 Revision)

### Level 1: REMEMBER

**Definition**: Retrieving relevant knowledge from long-term memory

**Action Verbs**:
- define, duplicate, list, memorize, recall, repeat, reproduce
- describe (basic), identify (basic)

**What This Looks Like**:
- Student can recall the definition of "specification"
- Student can list the 5 components of a spec
- Student can identify which example is a specification

**How to Assess**:
- Multiple choice: "Which is a specification?"
- Matching: Match term to definition
- Fill-in-the-blank: "A specification describes ___ in ___ way"
- Short-answer recall: "List 5 components of a spec"

**Time to teach**: 15-30 minutes
**Cognitive demand**: Minimal
**Prerequisite**: None (starting point)

**Example Test Item**:
```
Q: What are the 5 core components of a specification?
A: Intent, Inputs/Outputs, Requirements, NFRs, Acceptance Criteria
```

---

### Level 2: UNDERSTAND

**Definition**: Determining the meaning of instructional messages

**Action Verbs**:
- classify, describe, discuss, explain, identify, interpret, locate,
- recognize, report, select, sort, translate

**What This Looks Like**:
- Student can explain what makes a specification "clear"
- Student can describe why specs matter in teams
- Student can classify which spec component addresses which concern
- Student can translate a vague requirement into precise one

**How to Assess**:
- Short answer: "Why do acceptance criteria matter?"
- Concept map: How spec components relate to each other
- Essay: "Explain why vague specs fail with AI"
- Analogy: "A specification is like ___ because ___"

**Time to teach**: 30-60 minutes
**Cognitive demand**: Low-Moderate
**Prerequisite**: Remember-level knowledge

**Example Test Item**:
```
Q: A manager says "The system should be fast." Why is this a poor acceptance criterion?

A: Because "fast" is undefined.
   - Fast for who? (users? administrators?)
   - In what context? (normally responsive? during peak load?)
   - Measurable? (no way to test if achieved)
   - The spec lacks clarity.
```

---

### Level 3: APPLY

**Definition**: Using information in a new situation

**Action Verbs**:
- apply, change, choose, demonstrate, dramatize, interpret, practice,
- schedule, sketch, solve, use, write

**What This Looks Like**:
- Student can apply specification framework to a new problem
- Student can demonstrate how to write acceptance criteria
- Student can solve a requirement clarification problem
- Student can choose appropriate spec depth for context

**How to Assess**:
- Problem-solving task: "Write specification for this problem"
- Case study: "Here's a requirement; write acceptance criteria"
- Simulation: "Create spec for your capstone project"
- Practical exercise: Actual specification writing

**Time to teach**: 60-120 minutes
**Cognitive demand**: Moderate
**Prerequisite**: Remember + Understand

**Example Test Item**:
```
Q: A client says "Users should be able to reset their password"
   Write 3 acceptance criteria for this requirement.

A: - User receives password reset link by email within 30 seconds
   - User can create new password meeting complexity requirements
   - User can log in with new password immediately after reset
```

---

### Level 4: ANALYZE

**Definition**: Breaking material into parts and determining relationships

**Action Verbs**:
- appraise, compare, contrast, criticize, describe (complex), differentiate,
- discriminate, distinguish, examine, explain (complex), infer,
- relate, separate, subdivide

**What This Looks Like**:
- Student can analyze why one spec is better than another
- Student can compare spec-first vs. spec-anchored approaches
- Student can identify what makes a spec testable vs. vague
- Student can examine specification gaps in real example

**How to Assess**:
- Analysis essay: "Compare these two specs; identify strengths/weaknesses"
- Diagnostic task: "What's wrong with this spec? Why?"
- Decision matrix: "Evaluate spec approaches against criteria"
- Code review analogy: "Critique this specification"

**Time to teach**: 120-180 minutes
**Cognitive demand**: High
**Prerequisite**: Remember + Understand + Apply

**Example Test Item**:
```
Q: Compare these two specifications for a password reset feature.
   What are the strengths and weaknesses of each?

Spec A: "User can reset password"
Spec B: "User receives password reset email within 60 seconds of
         requesting reset. Link valid for 1 hour. User creates new
         password meeting requirements. New password works immediately."

Answer:
- Spec A is simple but unmeasurable (what's "can reset"?)
- Spec B is measurable, complete, but may be overly detailed
- For AI generation, Spec B is much more useful
```

---

### Level 5: EVALUATE

**Definition**: Making judgments based on criteria and standards

**Action Verbs**:
- appraise, argue, defend, judge, select, support, value, evaluate,
- critique, weigh

**What This Looks Like**:
- Student can defend why specification-first approach is better
- Student can evaluate whether a spec is ready for implementation
- Student can judge which SDD framework is best for situation
- Student can weigh tradeoffs between competing concerns

**How to Assess**:
- Debate/argue: "Defend your choice of spec framework"
- Critique essay: "Evaluate this spec for production readiness"
- Design review: "Should this spec be approved for development?"
- Justification: "Why is this the best approach? What are the alternatives?"

**Time to teach**: 180-300 minutes
**Cognitive demand**: Very High
**Prerequisite**: All previous levels

**Example Test Item**:
```
Q: Your team is deciding between "spec-first" and "spec-anchored"
   approaches for a 6-month project.

   Evaluate both approaches.
   Which would you recommend? Defend your choice.

Criteria to consider:
- Team experience with SDD
- Project complexity
- Stakeholder stability
- Risk tolerance
- Timeline
- Budget

Answer (varies, must be justified with reasoning):
"I recommend spec-first because... However, spec-anchored might be
better if... The key factor is..."
```

**Time to teach**: 300+ minutes
**Cognitive demand**: Expert/Mastery
**Prerequisite**: All previous levels + experience

**Example Test Item**:
```
Q: Design a specification process for a startup with:
   - No prior SDD experience
   - 5 developers, 1 product manager
   - 3-month timeline for MVP
   - Needs to iterate based on user feedback

Your design should address:
- How much time on specs vs. coding?
- What spec components are essential vs. optional?
- How to review/approve specs?
- How to handle changing requirements?
- How to train team on process?

Answer (varies, must be well-reasoned design):
[Detailed specification process design with justifications]
```

## Bloom's vs. Traditional Multiple-Choice Testing

### The Problem with "Teach to Remember"

**Traditional approach**: Focus on Remember level
```
80% of test items = "What is...", "Define...", "List..."
Result: Students memorize but can't apply
```

**Better approach**: Cognitive balance
```
10% Remember   - Basic definitions, recall
30% Understand - Explanation, interpretation
40% Apply      - Real-world problems, new situations
15% Analyze    - Comparison, breakdown of complex examples
5%  Evaluate   - Judgment and defense
```

**For SDD Course**:
- ✗ Don't ask: "What is a specification?" (Remember)
- ✓ Do ask: "Is this a good specification? Why/why not?" (Evaluate)
- ✗ Don't ask: "List 5 components" (Remember)
- ✓ Do ask: "Write a specification for your project" (Apply)

```
1. Short answer: "Explain why acceptance criteria must be testable.
   Use an example."

2. Analogy: "A specification is like _____ because _____"
   Example answer: "A map, because it shows the territory
   (problem space) that the code (journey) must navigate"

3. Concept map: Draw how these relate:
   Specification, Intent, Requirements, Acceptance Criteria,
   Testability, Clarity, SDD Loop
```

**Difficulty**: Easy-Moderate

   with no prior experience. Include curriculum, exercises, assessment."
```

**Difficulty**: Expert
**Time**: 4+ hours
**Cognitive value**: Mastery (advancing the field)

## Bloom's + CEFR Integration Example

### How They Work Together for "Specification Writing" Skill

#### Lesson Targeting A2 Level, Understand-Apply Cognitive Levels

**Learning Objective**:
"Student can understand specification components AND apply them
to simple, given problems"

**Assessment Design** (Remember only A2-level, Use Understand+Apply):

```
Remember (5%):
- Q: "What 5 components should a spec have?"
  (Establishes baseline)

Understand (30%):
- Q: "Explain why each component is important"
- Q: "Compare vague requirement vs. clear requirement"

Apply (65%):
- Task: "Write simple specification for given problem using template"
- Rubric: Does it have all 5 components? Are they clear?

(No Analyze/Evaluate/Create - that's B1+ level)
```

#### Lesson Targeting B1 Level, Apply-Analyze Cognitive Levels

**Learning Objective**:
"Student can apply specification writing to real problems AND
analyze specification quality"

**Assessment Design** (Remember is minimal; Emphasize Apply+Analyze):

```
Remember (5%):
- Quick review of components (1 question)

Understand (15%):
- Explain why spec quality matters in real context

Apply (50%):
- Write complete specification for real/capstone project
- Make decisions about depth, detail level, format

Analyze (30%):
- Analyze existing spec: identify gaps, ambiguities, improvements
- Compare two approaches: which is more complete? Why?

(No Evaluate/Create - that's B2+ level)
```

#### Lesson Targeting B2 Level, Analyze-Evaluate Cognitive Levels

**Learning Objective**:
"Student can evaluate specification approaches and defend decisions"

**Assessment Design** (Remember/Understand minimal; Emphasize Analyze+Evaluate):

```
Remember (2%):
- (Assumes knowledge - quick reference only)

Understand (8%):
- (Assumes comprehension - review only)

Apply (20%):
- (Assumes competence - refresher only)

Analyze (35%):
- Compare approaches: spec-first vs. code-first vs. spec-as-source
- Analyze context to determine best approach
- Break down spec quality into components

Evaluate (35%):
- Judge whether spec is ready for production
- Defend choice of approach for specific context
- Weigh tradeoffs and make strategic decisions

(No Create - that's C1+ level)
```

## Cognitive Load and Bloom's Levels

### Key Principle: Higher Cognitive Levels Take More Time

**Rough time allocations for skill mastery**:

```
Level 1 (Remember):        5-10 minutes
Level 2 (Understand):      15-30 minutes additional
Level 3 (Apply):           60-120 minutes additional
Level 4 (Analyze):         120-180 minutes additional
Level 5 (Evaluate):        180-300 minutes additional
Level 6 (Create):          300+ minutes + experience

Total for B1 (Apply+Analyze):     200-300 minutes = 3-5 hours
Total for B2 (Evaluate):          500-600 minutes = 8-10 hours
```

**Implication**: Can't teach B1 mastery in 30 minutes; need 3-5 hours

## Summary: Bloom's for SDD Teaching

**When designing lessons and assessment**:

1. **Match cognitive level to proficiency level**
   - A1 = Remember
   - A2 = Understand, Apply
   - B1 = Apply, Analyze
   - B2 = Analyze, Evaluate
   - C1 = Evaluate, Create

2. **Allocate assessment time appropriately**
   - Higher levels require more assessment time
   - Don't expect B1 mastery from 30-minute activity

3. **Include multiple levels in assessment**
   - Don't test only Remember-level (too easy)
   - Build to appropriate cognitive level for proficiency target

4. **Use action verbs precisely**
   - Learning objective: "Student can **analyze** spec quality" (specific level)
   - Not: "Student will understand specifications" (vague)

5. **Match assessment to cognitive level**
   - Remember → Multiple choice, matching
   - Apply → Case study, real problems
   - Evaluate → Critique, defense, trade-off analysis

---

**Used with**: CEFR proficiency levels for complete skill mapping
**Result**: Clear, measurable, internationally-recognized skill credentials
