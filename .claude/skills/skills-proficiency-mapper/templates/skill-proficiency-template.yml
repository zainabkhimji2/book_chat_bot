# NOTES FOR EDUCATORS
implementation_notes: |
  - This is foundation lesson - sets up all subsequent SDD content
  - Key insight: Help students EXPERIENCE the problem before proposing solution
  - Don't teach SDD as abstract framework; teach as response to real problem
  - Leave students frustrated by vague specs - then offer SDD as solution
  - This emotional engagement creates motivation for rest of Part 5
