# Constitution Compliance Checklist

This checklist evaluates content against the **CoLearning Python & Agentic AI: The AI-Driven Way** project constitution (Version 2.2.0).

**Result**: Content must achieve **PASS** status on all critical items to proceed. Constitution compliance is a GATE — failures block progression regardless of weighted scores.

---

## Instructions

For each section, evaluate content and mark:
- ✅ **Pass** — Fully compliant with constitutional requirement
- ⚠️ **Partial** — Partially compliant but needs minor improvement
- ❌ **Fail** — Non-compliant, requires significant revision

**Critical Items** (marked with 🔴): ANY failure results in overall **FAIL** status.
