## Purpose

The concept-scaffolding skill helps educators break down complex Python concepts into manageable, progressive learning steps that respect cognitive load limitations. This skill applies evidence-based strategies from Cognitive Load Theory and scaffolding research to create effective learning progressions.

## Relationship to Graduated Teaching Pattern (Constitution Principle 13)

**This skill determines HOW to break down concepts; the graduated teaching pattern determines WHO delivers each piece:**

**Graduated Teaching Pattern** (Constitution Principle 13) answers: "Should the book teach this, or should AI handle it?"
- **Tier 1 (Foundational):** Book teaches stable, basic concepts
- **Tier 2 (Complex):** AI companion handles complex syntax/execution
- **Tier 3 (Orchestration):** AI orchestrates scaling operations

**Concept Scaffolding** (this skill) answers: "How do I break this complex concept into progressive steps?"
- Applies cognitive load theory (max 2-4 concepts per step)
- Creates 3-7 step learning progressions
- Builds from simple to complex

**Integration in Practice:**

```
Teaching "Python Decorators" (complex concept):

Step 1: Apply concept-scaffolding to identify progression
   → Step 1: Functions as first-class objects (foundational)
   → Step 2: Functions returning functions (foundational)
   → Step 3: Simple decorator syntax (complex)
   → Step 4: Decorators with arguments (complex)
   → Step 5: Class-based decorators (complex)

Step 2: Apply graduated teaching pattern to each step
   → Steps 1-2: Book teaches directly (Tier 1 - foundational)
   → Steps 3-5: AI companion helps with complex syntax (Tier 2)
   → Practice: AI orchestrates applying decorators across project (Tier 3)
```

**Key Principle:** Use concept-scaffolding to break down the learning progression, then apply graduated teaching pattern to determine delivery method for each step.

## Nine Pillars of AI-Native Development Context (Constitution v3.1.2)

When scaffolding concepts, integrate the Nine Pillars framework:

1. **Evals-First**: Define success checkpoints BEFORE designing scaffolding steps
2. **Spec-Driven**: Each step should include a mini-spec (what, why, success criteria)
3. **AI as Co-Learning Partner**: Show how AI helps scaffold understanding (not just execute)
4. **Validation Skills Taught**: Include verification checkpoints after each step
5. **Graduated Complexity**: Respect tier limits (beginner: max 5 concepts, intermediate: 7, advanced: 10)
6. **Human Orchestration**: Student decides learning pace and which steps to explore deeper
7. **Prompt Quality**: When AI companion used, show clear prompts for each scaffolding step
8. **Tool Fluency**: Specify when book teaches vs. when AI companion helps
9. **Evolution Awareness**: For agentic concepts (Parts 6-7), note LLM vs. LAM distinctions

**Scaffolding Design Checklist**:
- [ ] Success evals defined for each step BEFORE creating content
- [ ] Each step specifies: Book teaches (Tier 1) or AI companion helps (Tier 2)
- [ ] Convergence opportunities identified (where student + AI iterate together)
- [ ] Validation checkpoints include both "Did I understand?" and "How do I verify?"
- [ ] Cognitive load respects tier limits from Nine Pillars #5

## When to Activate

Use this skill when:
- An educator needs to teach a complex Python concept incrementally
- Planning how to introduce advanced topics to learners
- A concept has multiple prerequisite dependencies
- Learners are struggling with cognitive overload
- Designing a progression from simple to complex understanding
- Creating worked examples with fading support
- Breaking down topics like: OOP, decorators, async/await, metaclasses, closures, generators

## Inputs

Required:
- **Concept name**: The complex Python concept to scaffold (e.g., "Python decorators")
- **Target audience**: beginner | intermediate | advanced

Optional:
- **Known prerequisites**: Concepts the learner already understands
- **Learning context**: classroom, self-paced, bootcamp, etc.
- **Time constraints**: Available instructional time

## Process

### Step 1: Understand the Concept Complexity

Analyze the target concept to identify:
- Core sub-concepts that must be understood
- Prerequisite knowledge required
- Common misconceptions or difficulty points
- Intrinsic cognitive load (inherent complexity)

### Step 2: Load Cognitive Load Theory Reference

Read the cognitive load theory reference for guidance:

```bash
Read reference/cognitive-load-theory.md
```

Key considerations:
- Working memory can hold 7±2 chunks
- Beginners: max 2 new concepts per step
- Intermediate: max 3 new concepts per step
- Advanced: max 4 new concepts per step

### Step 3: Design Scaffolding Progression

Create 3-7 progressive steps following these principles:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the simplest case or foundational concept
2. **Build Incrementally**: Each step adds 1-3 new concepts
3. **Check Prerequisites**: Ensure each step's prerequisites are met
4. **Include Worked Examples**: Provide complete examples for each step
5. **Add Checkpoints**: Include verification questions after each step

Load scaffolding strategies reference:

```bash
Read reference/scaffolding-strategies.md
```

Apply patterns:
- Worked examples (show complete solution)
- Completion problems (partial code to finish)
- Faded guidance (progressive support reduction)
- Chunking with checkpoints

### Step 4: Create Worked Examples

For each scaffolding step, create clear worked examples:

```bash
Read reference/worked-examples.md
```

Each example should:
- Demonstrate one primary concept clearly
- Include step-by-step explanation
- Explain reasoning (why, not just what)
- Use subgoal labels
- Be runnable and correct

### Step 5: Assess Cognitive Load

Create the scaffolding plan in YAML format following the template:

```bash
Read templates/scaffolding-plan-template.yml
```

Then validate cognitive load using the assessment script:

```bash
python .claude/skills/concept-scaffolding/scripts/assess-cognitive-load.py scaffolding-plan.yml
```

The script will:
- Calculate load for each step
- Identify overload warnings
- Check prerequisite chains
- Provide recommendations

### Step 6: Refine Based on Assessment

Review assessment output and refine if:
- Any step has "high" cognitive load (consider splitting)
- More than half the steps have high load (too much too fast)
- Circular dependencies detected (prerequisite issues)
- More than 7 steps total (consider consolidating)

### Step 7: Document Final Scaffolding Plan

Output the complete scaffolding plan with:
- Clear step titles and descriptions
- Worked examples for each step
- Checkpoint questions
- Cognitive load assessment
- Time estimates
- Prerequisites clearly stated

## Output Format

Provide scaffolding plan as structured markdown or YAML:

```markdown
# Scaffolding Plan: [Concept Name]

**Target Audience**: [beginner/intermediate/advanced]
**Total Steps**: [3-7]
**Estimated Time**: [X minutes]

## Examples

### Example 1: Scaffolding Python Decorators

**Input**: "How do I teach Python decorators to intermediate learners?"

**Process**:
1. Identify prerequisites: functions, closures, higher-order functions
2. Design 5-step progression:
   - Step 1: Functions as objects (can be assigned to variables)
   - Step 2: Functions returning functions
   - Step 3: Functions taking functions as arguments (higher-order)
   - Step 4: Simple decorator without arguments
   - Step 5: Decorators with arguments
3. Create worked examples for each step
4. Add checkpoints to verify understanding
5. Assess cognitive load (intermediate learners, 3 concepts max per step)

**Output**: Structured scaffolding plan with 5 steps, worked examples, checkpoints, and cognitive load warnings.

---

### Example 2: Scaffolding Async/Await

**Input**: "Break down async/await for beginners who understand functions and loops"

**Process**:
1. Identify high intrinsic load (concurrency is conceptually difficult)
2. Design 7-step progression:
   - Step 1: Synchronous execution review (baseline)
   - Step 2: Concept of "waiting" in code
   - Step 3: Basic async function definition
   - Step 4: Using await with async functions
   - Step 5: Running async functions with asyncio.run()
   - Step 6: Multiple async operations
   - Step 7: Error handling in async code
3. Use heavy scaffolding (worked examples, analogies)
4. Assess load (beginners, max 2 concepts per step)

**Output**: 7-step plan with extensive worked examples, real-world analogies, and frequent checkpoints.

---

### Example 3: Reviewing Existing Scaffolding

**Input**: "Is this scaffolding plan for list comprehensions effective?"
[Educator provides existing plan]

**Process**:
1. Load plan into assessment script
2. Check cognitive load per step
3. Verify prerequisite chains
4. Identify missing checkpoints or worked examples
5. Provide specific recommendations

**Output**: Assessment report with warnings and actionable recommendations.

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple → Realistic → Complex
```python
# Step 1: Simple (one concept)
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}"

# Step 2: Realistic (add common feature)
def greet(name, formal=False):
    return "Good day" if formal else f"Hello, {name}"

# Step 3: Complex (production-ready)
def greet(name: str, formal: bool = False, title: str = None) -> str:
    # [Full implementation with validation]
```

### Pattern 2: Concrete → Abstract
Start with specific, tangible examples before introducing general patterns.

### Pattern 3: Procedural → Object-Oriented
Introduce concepts procedurally first, then show OOP approach.

### Pattern 4: Co-Learning Convergence in Scaffolding (Constitution v3.1.2)

**CRITICAL**: Each scaffolding progression must demonstrate bidirectional learning between student and AI.

**Example: Scaffolding List Comprehensions with Convergence**

**Step 1 - Initial Understanding (Book teaches)**:
```python
# Traditional loop approach (foundational)
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = []
for n in numbers:
    squared.append(n ** 2)
```

**Step 2 - Student Attempts (Try With AI)**:
Student: "Convert this to a more Pythonic approach"
AI: Suggests list comprehension: `squared = [n**2 for n in numbers]`
**Student learns**: "I didn't know about list comprehensions—this is more concise!"

**Step 3 - Student Refines (Convergence)**:
Student: "Add filtering to only square even numbers"
AI: `squared = [n**2 for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]`
AI learns: Student wants to combine filtering + transformation
**Both converge**: Student understands filtering syntax; AI adapted to student's learning goal

**Step 4 - Student Orchestrates (Validation)**:
Student: "Explain when list comprehensions are better than loops"
AI: Provides tradeoffs (readability vs. complexity)
**Convergence outcome**: Student makes informed decisions, not just copies patterns

**Required Elements in Convergence-Based Scaffolding**:
- ✅ At least ONE step where student learns FROM AI's suggestion
- ✅ At least ONE step where AI adapts TO student's feedback
- ✅ Iteration shown (not "perfect on first try")
- ✅ Both parties contribute unique value
- ✅ Reflection prompt: "What did you learn from AI's approach?"

## Validation

Before finalizing scaffolding plan:
- [ ] Each step introduces ≤3 new concepts (≤2 for beginners)
- [ ] Total steps: 3-7
- [ ] Prerequisites explicitly stated
- [ ] Worked examples provided for each step
- [ ] Checkpoints included for verification
- [ ] Cognitive load assessed and acceptable
- [ ] Clear progression from simple to complex
- [ ] No circular dependencies in prerequisite chain

## Acceptance Checks

- [ ] Per-step verifiability: each step lists entry knowledge, single outcome, and a micro-check
- [ ] Cognitive Load Budget present for the lesson (Beginner default ≤ 5 new concepts total)

### Step snippet
```
Entry: knows lists, for-loops
Outcome: implement list comprehension with filter
Micro-check: “Write one comprehension that filters even numbers”
```

## Error Handling

If validation fails:
1. Report specific issues (e.g., "Step 3 introduces 5 concepts for beginner audience")
2. Suggest remediation (e.g., "Split step 3 into two steps")
3. Halt and require user intervention (hard failure mode)
