### Lesson 6: Capstone - AI Agent System (Multi-Service Concurrent Fetching + Parallel Inference)

**Proficiency Target**: B2 (integration and application)
**Duration**: 2.5-3 hours
**Estimated Word Count**: 3,000-3,500 words + capstone project

**Learning Objectives** (Bloom's progression):
1. Integrate all chapter concepts into a production-style AI agent (Create — B2)
2. Build a system fetching from multiple services concurrently (Create — B2)
3. Process responses with simulated LLM inference in parallel (Create — B2)
4. Handle errors, timeouts, and graceful degradation (Create — B2)
5. Explain architecture and performance tradeoffs to AI collaborator (Evaluate — B2)

**Skills Taught** (CEFR/Bloom's mapping):
1. **System Integration** — B2 — Technical — Create
   - Measurable: Student integrates all 5 prior lessons into one cohesive system
2. **Multi-Service Orchestration** — B2 — Technical — Create
   - Measurable: Student implements TaskGroup for 3+ concurrent API sources
3. **Parallel Inference Simulation** — B2 — Technical — Create
   - Measurable: Student processes responses in parallel with InterpreterPoolExecutor
4. **Production Error Handling** — B2 — Technical — Create
   - Measurable: Student implements timeouts, retries, partial success handling
5. **Architecture Explanation** — B2 — Technical — Evaluate
   - Measurable: Student articulates design decisions and tradeoffs to AI

**Key Concepts** (All from prior lessons, now integrated):
1. TaskGroup for concurrent API fetching
2. InterpreterPoolExecutor for parallel inference
3. Timeout management and error handling
4. Graceful degradation (best-effort results)
5. Performance measurement and optimization
6. Real-world architectural patterns

**Capstone Project Specification**:

**System Description**: Build an AI Agent that queries multiple information sources (weather API, news API, knowledge base) concurrently, processes each response with simulated LLM inference (CPU-intensive text analysis), and aggregates results into a unified response—all while handling failures gracefully.

**Requirements**:
1. **Concurrent Fetching**: Use `TaskGroup()` to fetch from 3+ sources in parallel
2. **Parallel Processing**: Use `InterpreterPoolExecutor` to simulate LLM inference (heavy string processing)
3. **Error Handling**: If one source times out, continue with others (partial success)
4. **Timeout Control**: Each API call has 5s timeout, overall system has 15s timeout
5. **Graceful Degradation**: System provides best-effort response even if 1-2 sources fail
6. **Performance**: Demonstrate hybrid execution is 2-3x faster than sequential

**Code Skeleton** (students implement with AI guidance):

```python
# types and configuration
async def fetch_weather(city: str) -> dict[str, Any]: ...
async def fetch_news(query: str) -> list[dict[str, Any]]: ...
async def query_knowledge_base(question: str) -> str: ...

def simulate_llm_inference(text: str) -> str:
    # CPU-intensive processing (runs in InterpreterPoolExecutor)
    ...

async def ai_agent_query(user_question: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
    # Student implements using TaskGroup + InterpreterPoolExecutor
    ...
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All 3 sources fetched concurrently (measured: ~5s total, not 15s sequential)
- [ ] Processing happens in parallel (CPU usage spikes across multiple cores)
- [ ] System handles partial failures (1 source down → still returns results from others)
- [ ] Total execution time < 15s with timeouts applied
- [ ] Code includes type hints, error handling, and logging
- [ ] Student explains architecture to AI and receives feedback (validates understanding)

**Content Outline**:
- **Hook** (5 min): Show what students will build—real-world AI agent pattern
- **Part 1: Architecture Overview** (15 min): Diagram showing concurrent fetch + parallel inference
- **Part 2: Code Walkthrough** (20 min): Skeleton code explained, what student implements, what AI helps with
- **Part 3: Implementation Guidance** (30 min): Step-by-step implementation with AI partnership pattern
- **Part 4: Testing and Optimization** (15 min): Measure performance, identify bottlenecks, optimize
- **Part 5: Reflection and Extension** (10 min): What you learned, how to extend further
- **Engagement Elements** (throughout): CoLearning on building real systems

**Capstone Code Example** (Complete structure with guidance):
```python
# File: ai_agent.py
import asyncio
from concurrent.futures import Executor
from typing import Any

# Simulated API sources (students implement with AI help)
async def fetch_weather(city: str, *, timeout: float = 5.0) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Fetch weather data for a city. Simulated with asyncio.sleep()."""
    try:
        async with asyncio.timeout(timeout):
            # Simulate network call
            await asyncio.sleep(2)
            return {"city": city, "temp": 72, "condition": "sunny"}
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        return {"error": "Weather API timeout"}

async def fetch_news(query: str, *, timeout: float = 5.0) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    """Fetch news articles. Simulated with asyncio.sleep()."""
    try:
        async with asyncio.timeout(timeout):
            await asyncio.sleep(1.5)
            return [
                {"title": f"Article 1 about {query}", "snippet": "..."},
                {"title": f"Article 2 about {query}", "snippet": "..."},
            ]
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        return [{"error": "News API timeout"}]

def simulate_llm_inference(text: str) -> str:
    """CPU-intensive inference simulation. Runs in executor."""
    # Simulate heavy processing
    import time
    start = time.time()
    while time.time() - start < 2:  # 2 seconds of CPU work
        _ = sum(i**2 for i in range(100000))
    return f"Analysis of '{text[:50]}...': [Result from inference]"

async def ai_agent_query(
    user_question: str,
    executor: Executor | None = None
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Main agent function. Students implement this with AI help.

    Pattern:
    1. Use TaskGroup for concurrent fetching
    2. Use executor.run_in_executor() for CPU-bound inference
    3. Handle errors gracefully
    4. Return aggregated results
    """
    # Student implementation here
    pass

# Performance benchmark
async def benchmark_hybrid_system() -> None:
    """Compare sequential vs concurrent+parallel execution."""
    print("Running hybrid AI agent benchmark...")

    from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor, ThreadPoolExecutor
    from time import perf_counter

    # Sequential version (baseline)
    # ...

    # Hybrid concurrent+parallel version
    # ...

    # Print timing comparison

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(ai_agent_query("What's the weather and latest news?"))
```

**Practice Approach**:
- Scaffold 1: Implement fetch functions (students write, AI reviews)
- Scaffold 2: Implement concurrent fetching with TaskGroup (guided implementation)
- Scaffold 3: Integrate inference processing with executor (guided implementation)
- Scaffold 4: Add error handling and timeouts (students design, AI generates)
- Scaffold 5: Measure and optimize performance (students measure, AI suggests optimizations)

**CoLearning Elements**:
- 💬 **Prompt 1** (after architecture overview): "Explain how this architecture handles the case where 2/3 sources timeout"
- 🎓 **Commentary 1** (after code walkthrough): "This is what production AI systems look like—resilient, concurrent, and optimized"
- 🚀 **Challenge 1** (after implementation): "Add caching to avoid re-fetching recent queries within 60 seconds"
- ✨ **Tip 1** (after performance measurement): "Ask AI to review your error handling strategy and suggest improvements"

**End-of-Lesson: Try With AI** (4 prompts, Bloom's progression):

1. **Understand Level**: "Ask your AI: 'Walk me through the execution flow of this AI agent. What happens in parallel vs sequentially?'"
   - Expected Output: AI explains concurrent fetching, then parallel inference, then aggregation

2. **Apply Level**: "Tell your AI: 'I need to handle the case where one source is permanently down. Implement fallback logic.'"
   - Expected Output: Student verifies system returns results from working sources, handles missing source gracefully

3. **Analyze Level**: "Ask your AI: 'Where is the bottleneck in this system? CPU or I/O? How do I identify it? How would you optimize?'"
   - Expected Output: Student uses profiling/timing to identify bottleneck, adjusts worker counts or API calls

4. **Evaluate Level**: "Review: Ask your AI to evaluate your implementation against production requirements: fault tolerance, performance, scalability. What would you change for real-world use?"
   - Expected Output: Student discusses rate limiting, circuit breakers, monitoring, real API integration

**Risks & Mitigations**:

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Students confuse concurrency with parallelism | Explicit distinction in Lesson 1, benchmarks in Lessons 2, 4, 5 showing difference |
| Students continue using deprecated patterns | Prominent Python 3.14+ warnings, deprecation error examples |
| GIL brief intro confuses students | Limited to 2-3 sentences, explicit forward reference to Ch 29 with rationale |
| InterpreterPoolExecutor is new (Python 3.14), fewer online examples | Position as cutting-edge, use AI tools to fill gaps, provide complete working examples |
| Capstone too complex | Scaffold with skeleton code, iterative implementation with AI guidance |
| Students attempt to run async code in Jupyter | Teach `asyncio.run()` pattern which works in modern Jupyter, mention `nest_asyncio` as fallback only |
| Cognitive overload (10 concepts per lesson) | Graduated complexity across lessons, CoLearning elements paced throughout, hands-on validation via AI |
