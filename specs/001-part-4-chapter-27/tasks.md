## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all lessons (code examples must be tested first)
- **Lessons (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - Lessons can proceed sequentially (L1 → L2 → L3 → L4 → L5 → L6)
  - Human review after each lesson before proceeding to next
  - Each lesson is independently completable and reviewable
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all 6 lessons being complete

### Lesson Dependencies

- **Lesson 1 (L1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other lessons
- **Lesson 2 (L2)**: Can start after Foundational - Extends L1 concepts but independently testable
- **Lesson 3 (L3)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies (new topic: Generics)
- **Lesson 4 (L4)**: Can start after Foundational - Extends L3 concepts but independently testable
- **Lesson 5 (L5)**: Can start after Foundational - Integrates L1-L4 concepts (Pydantic + Generics for AI)
- **Lesson 6 (L6)**: Can start after Foundational - Capstone synthesizes all prior lessons

### Within Each Lesson

- Create lesson file first (frontmatter, structure)
- Write sections sequentially (Introduction → Sections → Common Mistakes → Try With AI)
- Position CoLearning elements THROUGHOUT content (not just at end)
- Integrate code examples where pedagogically appropriate
- "Try With AI" section is ALWAYS the final section (lesson closure)
- Validate against acceptance criteria before marking complete
- Human review and approval before proceeding to next lesson

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks (T001-T004) can run in parallel
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: All code example tasks (T005-T013) can run in parallel - different files, no dependencies
- **Phase 9 (Polish)**: Most validation tasks (T156-T164, T167, T169) can run in parallel
- **Within lessons**: CoLearning element positioning tasks can be done during initial writing
- **Content sections**: Each section within a lesson can be written in sequence but reviewed in parallel by different reviewers

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 2 (Foundational Code Examples)

```bash
# Launch all code example creation tasks together:
Task: "Create and test EX-001: Basic Pydantic Model"
Task: "Create and test EX-002: Nested Models"
Task: "Create and test EX-003: Field Validators"
Task: "Create and test EX-004: Settings from Environment"
Task: "Create and test EX-005: Generic Function"
Task: "Create and test EX-006: Generic Container Class"
Task: "Create and test EX-007: Bounded Generic"
Task: "Create and test EX-008: LLM Output Validation"
Task: "Create and test EX-009: Config Manager Capstone"

# All examples are independent - can be created and tested simultaneously
```

7. **Complete Phase 7: Lesson 5** → Human review → Approve
8. **Complete Phase 8: Lesson 6** → Human review → Approve
9. **Complete Phase 9: Polish & Validation** → Technical review → Final approval

**Checkpoints**: After each lesson, validate independently before proceeding

### Iterative Refinement Per Lesson

Each lesson follows this micro-workflow:

1. Create lesson file with structure
2. Write all sections sequentially
3. Position CoLearning elements throughout
4. Integrate code examples
5. Add "Try With AI" prompts (4 per lesson)
6. Self-validate against acceptance criteria
7. Submit for human review
8. Incorporate feedback
9. Mark lesson complete → Proceed to next

### Quality Gates

- **After Phase 2**: All code examples must run without errors on Python 3.14+ with Pydantic V2
- **After Each Lesson**: Human review and approval required
- **After Lesson 3**: Mid-chapter check (Pydantic fundamentals complete)
- **After Lesson 6**: Capstone completeness check (portfolio-worthy project delivered)
- **Phase 9**: Technical-reviewer validation (comprehensive constitutional compliance check)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Lesson] label** maps task to specific lesson for traceability
- Each lesson should be independently completable and reviewable
- Commit after each lesson or logical group of tasks
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate lesson independently
- **Lesson closure pattern**: ONLY "Try With AI" section at end (constitutional requirement)
- **CoLearning elements**: Must be positioned THROUGHOUT lessons, not batched at end
- **Code examples**: All must be tested before integration into lessons
- **Proficiency levels**: B1 → B1-B2 → B2 progression validated across 6 lessons
- **Avoid**: Forward references to Ch 30+, SDD terminology, lesson summaries after "Try With AI"

## Task Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 169
- **Setup Tasks**: 4 (Phase 1)
- **Foundational Tasks**: 9 code examples (Phase 2)
- **Lesson 1 Tasks**: 21 (Phase 3)
- **Lesson 2 Tasks**: 23 (Phase 4)
- **Lesson 3 Tasks**: 22 (Phase 5)
- **Lesson 4 Tasks**: 24 (Phase 6)
- **Lesson 5 Tasks**: 24 (Phase 7)
- **Lesson 6 Tasks**: 28 (Phase 8 - Capstone)
- **Polish & Validation Tasks**: 14 (Phase 9)

**Parallel Opportunities**: 27 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases

**Independent Completion**: Each of the 6 lessons can be validated independently before moving to next

**MVP Scope**: Lessons 1-3 (Pydantic + Generics fundamentals) form minimal viable chapter; Lessons 4-6 add advanced patterns and capstone

## Lesson Author Policy Note

**Constitutional Requirement (Rule 6 - Lesson Closure Pattern)**:

Within this chapter, each lesson MUST end with a single final section titled **"Try With AI"** containing exactly 4 prompts following Bloom's taxonomy progression (Understand/Remember → Apply → Analyze/Evaluate → Create/Synthesize).

**FORBIDDEN after "Try With AI"**:
- ❌ Key Takeaways sections
- ❌ Summary sections
- ❌ What's Next sections
- ❌ Review checklists
- ❌ Any additional content

**AI Tool References**:
- Part 4 students have completed Part 2 (AI Tool Landscape)
- Use phrasing: "Tell your AI..." or "Ask your AI..."
- Students may use Claude Code, Gemini CLI, ChatGPT web, or their preferred AI tool
- No need to specify which tool in prompts (student choice)

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Each "Try With AI" prompt MUST include explicit **Expected Outcome** describing what students should receive from their AI

This ensures consistent pedagogical structure across all Part 4 chapters and aligns with AI-Native Learning pedagogy.
