## Dependencies & Lesson Completion Order

**Strict Sequential Dependencies**:
```
Phase 1 (Setup) → Phase 2 (Lesson 1) → Phase 3 (Lesson 2) → Phase 4 (Lesson 3) → Phase 5 (Lesson 4) → Phase 6 (Lesson 5) → Phase 7 (Polish)
```

**Why Sequential**: Each lesson builds on prior concepts. Lesson boundaries validated. No parallel lesson writing.

**Within-Lesson Parallelization**: Tasks within same lesson marked [P] can be done in parallel (e.g., T010-T013 create different code examples simultaneously).

---

## Parallel Execution Examples

**Setup Phase (T001-T004)**: All can run in parallel (different setup tasks)

**Lesson 1 (T010-T013)**: Code examples can be written in parallel
**Lesson 1 (T014-T016)**: Exercises can be written in parallel
**Lesson 1 (T017-T020)**: CoLearning elements can be placed in parallel

**Lesson 2-4**: Same parallelization pattern (code examples, exercises, CoLearning)

**Lesson 5**: Most tasks sequential (capstone builds incrementally)

**Polish Phase (T108-T116)**: All validation tasks can run in parallel

---

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope** (Minimum Viable Product):
- **Phase 1-2**: Lesson 1 (Exception Fundamentals) only
- **Why**: Establishes foundation; independently testable; delivers immediate value

**Incremental Delivery**:
1. **Sprint 1**: Lesson 1 (foundation)
2. **Sprint 2**: Lesson 2 (multi-block handling)
3. **Sprint 3**: Lesson 3 (raising/custom exceptions)
4. **Sprint 4**: Lesson 4 (strategies)
5. **Sprint 5**: Lesson 5 (capstone integration)
6. **Sprint 6**: Polish and validation

**Total Estimated Effort**: 119 tasks across 7 phases

---

## Task Summary

| Phase | Tasks | Parallelizable | Sequential | Focus |
|-------|-------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| 1: Setup | 4 | 2 | 2 | Chapter infrastructure |
| 2: Lesson 1 | 21 | 15 | 6 | Exception fundamentals (A2) |
| 3: Lesson 2 | 20 | 14 | 6 | Multi-block handling (A2-B1) |
| 4: Lesson 3 | 19 | 13 | 6 | Raising/custom exceptions (B1) |
| 5: Lesson 4 | 20 | 14 | 6 | Error handling strategies (B1) |
| 6: Lesson 5 | 22 | 4 | 18 | Capstone integration (B1) |
| 7: Polish | 13 | 12 | 1 | Validation and publication |
| **TOTAL** | **119** | **74** | **45** | **5 lessons + polish** |

**Parallel Opportunities**: 62% of tasks (74/119) can run in parallel within their phase
**Critical Path**: 45 sequential tasks determine minimum timeline

---

## Policy Notes for Lesson Authors

**Lesson Closure Pattern** (Constitution Mandate):
- Every lesson MUST end with "Try With AI" section containing exactly 4 prompts
- NO "Key Takeaways", "Summary", "What's Next", or "Completion Checklist" after "Try With AI"
- Prompt 4 provides cognitive closure through synthesis/reflection

**AI Tool References**:
- Part 1 (before tool onboarding): Use ChatGPT web in "Try With AI" sections
- Part 2+ (after Claude Code/Gemini CLI introduction): Instruct learners to use their preferred AI companion tool
- Optionally provide both CLI and web variants for flexibility

**No SDD Terminology in Part 4**:
- Use "describe intent" (NOT "write specification")
- Use "type hints and clear code" (NOT "formal specifications")
- References to AIDD from Part 1 are acceptable for context
- Formal SDD taught in Part 5 (Chapters 30+)

**Forward References**:
- Zero references to Chapters 22+ content
- Chapter 21 scope only (exception handling)
- Non-goals explicitly listed in spec.md (context managers deep dive, async exceptions, logging configuration deferred)

---

## Next Steps After Task Completion

1. **Run `/sp.implement`**: Invoke lesson-writer subagent with this tasks.md as checklist
2. **Technical Review**: Run technical-reviewer subagent on completed lessons
3. **User Review**: Present completed chapter for human feedback
4. **Iterate**: Address feedback, refine lessons
5. **Publish**: Merge to main branch, update chapter-index.md status
