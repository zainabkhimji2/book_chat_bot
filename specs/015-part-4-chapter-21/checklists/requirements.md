**Feature**: Chapter 21 Exception Handling (spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - Spec focuses on learning objectives, concepts, and pedagogy
  - Python is teaching vehicle, not implementation detail

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - User stories centered on student learning outcomes
  - Success evals tied to comprehension, skill, application, confidence, accessibility

- [x] Written for learners and educators (not just developers)
  - Clear distinction between what book teaches vs what AI handles
  - Pedagogical direction explicit (Tier 1/2/3 teaching patterns)

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - Overview, evals, user scenarios, requirements, success criteria, lessons, capstone

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - All design decisions made based on user answers
  - Scope, audience, pedagogical approach clear

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - FR-001 through FR-009 are specific and measurable
  - Each lesson has clear acceptance scenarios

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - SC-001 through SC-008 include specific metrics (80%+, 75%+, Grade 7-8 level, etc.)
  - Criteria tied to student learning outcomes

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
  - No mention of specific Python versions, frameworks, or tools
  - Focused on learning outcomes and student capability

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - User Story 1: 3 acceptance scenarios (try/except flow)
  - User Story 2: 3 acceptance scenarios (raise/custom exceptions)
  - User Story 3: 3 acceptance scenarios (capstone project)

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - What happens when exception handler raises exception?
  - Exception chaining behavior (raise from)
  - Context manager usage patterns
  - Catching specific vs generic exceptions

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - 5 lessons from foundational to capstone
  - 7 core concepts (not more, not less for intermediate tier)
  - No forward references to Chapters 22+
  - Non-goals explicitly listed (context managers deep dive, async exceptions, etc.)

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - Prerequisites: Chapters 1-20 content
  - Assumptions: Python 3.14+, Claude Code/Gemini CLI, Grade 7-8 reading level
  - Non-goals: Deferred to later chapters

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - FR-001: Teaching 7 concepts → SC-007 (all 4 prompts per lesson)
  - FR-002: 5 lessons → SC-001 through SC-005 (each lesson has measurable outcome)
  - FR-003: "Try With AI" format → SC-007 (4 prompts with expected outcomes)
  - FR-004: CoLearning elements → Acceptance criteria in spec
  - FR-005: Python 3.14+ code → Example code provided
  - FR-006: Real capstone → Specification and validation steps defined
  - FR-007: 3-4 hour duration → Lesson structure supports this
  - FR-008: No forward references → Non-goals section confirms chapter boundary
  - FR-009: "Describe intent" language → Overview and pedagogical direction use this framing

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - P1: Fundamentals (try/except/else/finally) — foundation for all other learning
  - P2: Raising exceptions (custom classes) — enables defensive functions
  - P3: Real capstone (file parser) — demonstrates integrated application

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - All 8 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) are achievable with 5-lesson structure
  - Capstone project specification enables measurement of learning
  - CEFR progression (A2 → B1) supports measurable skill advancement

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - Spec doesn't specify which exceptions to cover in which lesson
  - Spec doesn't dictate code structure or algorithm choices
  - Lesson content will be determined during implementation phase

## AI-Native Learning Alignment

- [x] AI-Native Learning pattern clearly described
  - Describe intent (type hints, clear goals)
  - Explore with AI (ask questions)
  - Validate together (test code)
  - Learn from errors (ask "why?")

- [x] CoLearning elements specified (not just at end of lessons)
  - 💬 AI Colearning Prompt (foundational understanding)
  - 🎓 Instructor Commentary (reasoning > syntax)
  - 🚀 CoLearning Challenge (specification-driven thinking)
  - ✨ Teaching Tip (AI tool literacy)

- [x] "Try With AI" lesson closure pattern specified
  - Exactly 4 prompts per lesson (Bloom's progression)
  - Prompts: Recall → Understand → Apply → Analyze/Synthesize
  - Expected outcomes for each prompt
  - NO additional summaries or checklists after this section

- [x] Graduated teaching pattern (Tier 1/2/3) explicit
  - Tier 1 (Book teaches): Foundations, basic structures
  - Tier 2 (AI Companion): Complex syntax, patterns
  - Tier 3 (Capstone): Integration, real scenarios

- [x] No formal SDD terminology (appropriate for Part 4)
  - Uses "describe intent" not "write specification"
  - References "AI-Native Learning" not "Specification-Driven Development"
  - Prepares for SDD in Part 5

---

## Pedagogical Quality

- [x] CEFR proficiency levels assigned and justified
  - Lesson 1: A2 (recognition + simple application)
  - Lesson 2: A2-B1 (multiple patterns, deeper understanding)
  - Lessons 3-5: B1 (independent application in unfamiliar problems)
  - Progression clear: A2 → B1

- [x] Cognitive load within limits (max 7 concepts for intermediate)
  - 7 core concepts defined: Exceptions as Objects, try/except/else/finally, Exception Types, Raising Exceptions, Custom Exceptions, Error Handling Strategies, Context Managers (overview)
  - Each concept clearly described
  - Spread across 5 lessons (not overloaded in any single lesson)

- [x] Code examples are minimal and focused
  - 5 examples provided (one per lesson, roughly)
  - Each example demonstrates single concept
  - All examples use modern Python 3.14+ syntax (type hints, etc.)

- [x] Capstone project is realistic and achievable
  - CSV file parser (real-world scenario)
  - Handles 4+ error types (FileNotFoundError, ValueError, PermissionError, etc.)
  - Validation steps clear
  - Builds on Lessons 1-4 (no new concepts introduced)

---

## Part 4 Appropriateness

- [x] Intermediate complexity (not too easy, not too hard for Part 4)
  - Builds on Chapters 12-20 (variables, functions, control flow)
  - Prepares for Chapters 22-25 (file I/O, OOP)
  - Real capstone demonstrates "thinking like a developer"

- [x] No forward references to Chapters 22+
  - Non-goals explicitly list deferred topics (context managers deep dive, async exceptions, logging configuration)
  - Dependencies section lists what will be used later, not what is taught now

- [x] AI-Native Learning framing (not formal methodology)
  - Emphasizes AI as co-reasoning partner
  - Students describe intent, explore, validate, learn from errors
  - Prepares mindset for formal SDD in Part 5

---

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

- [x] All acceptance criteria in spec are achievable during implementation
  - 5 lessons can be written to meet all criteria
  - Capstone project specification enables validation
  - CoLearning elements can be distributed throughout lessons
  - "Try With AI" format is standardized and replicable

- [x] No artificial constraints that limit quality
  - 7 concepts is right amount for intermediate (not too many)
  - 5 lessons allows proper progression without rushing
  - 3-4 hour estimate is reasonable for intermediate material
  - 4 "Try With AI" prompts gives enough exploration without fatigue

## Overall Quality Assessment

✅ **SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

**Summary**:
- All mandatory sections completed
- 9 functional requirements defined with clear acceptance criteria
- 8 measurable success criteria tied to learning outcomes
- CEFR A2-B1 progression clear
- 7 core concepts within cognitive load limits for intermediate tier
- Real capstone project specification enables validation
- No forward references; chapter boundaries respected
- AI-Native Learning pattern fully specified
- No implementation details leaked into spec
- Part 4 appropriateness confirmed

**Next Steps**:
1. User reviews and approves specification
2. Run `/sp.clarify` if any ambiguities
3. Run `/sp.plan` to generate detailed lesson plan with CEFR levels and skills mapping
4. Run `/sp.tasks` to generate implementation checklist
5. Run `/sp.implement` to write 5 lessons

## Notes

- Specification applies /sp.python-chapter intelligent context (constitution, chapter-index, user answers)
- All user preferences honored: Start fresh (vs adapt), Core + patterns (vs breadth only), Real capstone (vs guided practice)
- Three-tier teaching pattern fully integrated (book → AI Companion → capstone demonstration)
- Specification demonstrates professional pedagogy standards (evals-first, graduated complexity, AI partnership)
