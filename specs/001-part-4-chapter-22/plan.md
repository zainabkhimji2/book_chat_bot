## 🎯 Chapter Overview & Context

**Building on Chapter 21 Foundation**:
- Chapter 21 taught: Exception handling fundamentals (try/except/finally, raising exceptions, custom exceptions)
- Chapter 22 builds on this by teaching: File I/O with error handling, path management, structured data formats, console interaction

**Bridge to Chapter 23**:
- Chapter 22 completes Python's core I/O capabilities (console, file operations, structured formats)
- Chapter 23 (Math, DateTime, Calendar) will build on file-based workflows — students will timestamp files, store configuration

**Prerequisites Established**:
- Chapter 13: Python basics (variables, print(), basic I/O)
- Chapter 14: Data types (strings, lists, dicts, understanding structured data)
- Chapter 15: Operators and type conversion (string/int conversion for input validation)
- Chapter 16: Strings and type casting (f-strings for formatted output)
- Chapter 17: Control flow and loops (iterating through file lines, menu-driven loops)
- Chapter 18: Lists, tuples, dicts (in-memory data structures before file persistence)
- Chapter 19: Sets and collections (understanding different container types)
- Chapter 20: Modules and functions (importing csv, json, pathlib modules; function design for reusability)
- Chapter 21: Exception handling (try/except for FileNotFoundError, JSONDecodeError, IOError)

**AI-Native Learning Pattern** (how students learn I/O with AI):
- **Tier 1 - Foundational**: Book teaches stable concepts: What is I/O? Why context managers? What are file modes? Pathlib basics.
- **Tier 2 - Complex Execution**: AI companion handles syntax-heavy operations. Student describes intent ("read a config file and validate required fields"), AI generates code with json.load() and validation, student learns strategy not syntax.
- **Tier 3 - Scaling Operations**: AI orchestrates batch operations. Student describes ("set up 10-category directory structure"), AI generates mkdir(parents=True) loop, student learns orchestration mindset.

**Key Scope Boundaries** (Chapter 22 Responsibility):
- ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: Console I/O (input validation, formatted output), file modes and context managers, pathlib (existence checks, directory creation, path operations, glob patterns), CSV/JSON formats with encoding, error handling for file operations, path traversal security, menu-driven CLI loop design
- ✅ **Practical Application**: Note-Taking App capstone integrating all concepts at enterprise scale (10-50 notes, multiple categories, search functionality)
- ⚠️ **Awareness Only**: Binary file formats, pickle (security concerns), advanced asyncio file operations, streaming large files (10GB+), database connections
- ❌ **Deferred**: Advanced encoding (UTF-16, shift-jis), compression (gzip, zip), network I/O, memory-mapped files, Chapter 28 (Asyncio) for async file operations, Chapter 29 (CPython) for buffer internals

    while True:
        try:
            value_str: str = input(prompt)
            value: int = int(value_str)
            if value <= 0:

**CoLearning Elements** (integrated throughout, not just at end):

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt (after Code Example 1.1)
> "Explain what happens inside Python when I use `int()` on the string '25'. What error would I get if I tried `int('hello')`?"

**Expected Outcome**: Student understands type conversion mechanism and error conditions before practicing

#### 🎓 Instructor Commentary (after showing try/except)
> In AI-native development, you don't memorize exception types — you understand WHEN type conversion fails. Ask AI: "What exceptions can occur when converting user input?" Your job is designing the validation strategy; syntax is cheap.

#### 🚀 CoLearning Challenge (after Code Example 1.2)
Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Generate a function that asks for a user's email and validates it contains '@' and a domain. Then explain how string methods like `.count()` and `.find()` work."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll understand string validation and method chains beyond f-strings

#### ✨ Teaching Tip (before console output formatting)
> Use Claude Code to explore: "How many different ways can I format a floating-point number in an f-string? Show me examples for currency, percentages, and scientific notation."

**Practice Approach**:

**Exercise 1**: Write a program that asks for a user's name and favorite number, validates the number is positive, then displays formatted output
- Acceptance: Code runs without crashes on both valid and invalid input
- Validation: Try with positive int, negative int, text input

**Exercise 2**: Create an input validation function that ensures a string has minimum length
- Acceptance: Function rejects empty strings and strings shorter than specified minimum
- Validation: Test with edge cases (empty, exactly minimum, longer)

**End-of-Lesson: Try With AI** (4 prompts with Bloom's progression):

**Prompt 1 - Remember/Understand**:
```
Ask your AI: "What does the input() function return? Show me an example."

Expected Outcome: You'll understand that input() always returns a string,
regardless of what the user types.
```

**Prompt 2 - Apply**:
```
Ask your AI: "Write a program that asks for a user's age and height,
converts both to numbers, then calculates BMI. Add error handling for invalid input."

Expected Outcome: You'll see input validation, type conversion, and calculation patterns combined.
```

**Prompt 3 - Analyze**:
```
Ask your AI: "Compare two approaches to input validation: (1) try/except with retry loop,
(2) input validation in a separate function. Which is better and why?"

Expected Outcome: You'll understand different validation patterns and when each applies.
```

**Prompt 4 - Synthesize/Create** (cognitive closure):
```
Ask your AI: "Design a quiz program that asks 5 multiple-choice questions,
validates user input (A-D only), tracks score, and displays a formatted final result.
What would the overall structure look like?"

Expected Outcome: You'll see how console I/O patterns combine to build an interactive application,
preparing you for the menu-driven capstone.
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Student can write input validation code without runtime crashes
- Student can explain why input() returns string and conversion is necessary
- Student can use f-strings to format output professionally
- Student can implement try/except retry loops for invalid input

**Code Example 3.1: Creating Paths with pathlib**
```python
from pathlib import Path

# Create Path objects
home: Path = Path.home()  # User's home directory
docs: Path = Path("documents")  # Relative path
config_file: Path = Path("config") / "app.json"  # Using / operator

# Path properties
print(f"Full path: {config_file}")          # config/app.json
print(f"File name: {config_file.name}")     # app.json
print(f"Suffix: {config_file.suffix}")      # .json
print(f"Stem: {config_file.stem}")          # app
print(f"Parent: {config_file.parent}")      # config

# Join paths across platforms (Windows uses \, Unix uses /)

    if config_path.is_file():
        print("  → It's a file")
    elif config_path.is_dir():
        print("  → It's a directory")
else:
    print(f"{config_path} does not exist")

# Common pattern: check before operations
if not data_dir.exists():
    print(f"{data_dir} directory doesn't exist yet")

# exist_ok=True doesn't raise error if directory already exists
notes_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

# Create category subdirectories
categories: list[str] = ["work", "personal", "learning"]
for category in categories:
    category_dir: Path = notes_dir / category
    category_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    print(f"Created: {category_dir}")

# Verify structure
if notes_dir.exists():

# Create some test files
(notes_dir / "meeting.txt").write_text("Team standup")
(notes_dir / "todo.txt").write_text("Buy groceries")
(notes_dir / "notes.md").write_text("# Python Study")
(notes_dir / "archive.txt").write_text("Old data")

# Find all .txt files
txt_files: list[Path] = list(notes_dir.glob("*.txt"))
print(f"Found {len(txt_files)} .txt files:")
for file in txt_files:
    print(f"  - {file.name}")

# Find all files (any type)
all_files: list[Path] = list(notes_dir.glob("*"))

def read_note(base_dir: Path, user_input: str) -> str | None:
    """Read a note file with security validation."""
    # Resolve the requested path to canonical form
    requested_path: Path = (base_dir / user_input).resolve()

    # Check that resolved path stays within base directory
    # is_relative_to() ensures path is under base_dir
    if not requested_path.is_relative_to(base_dir.resolve()):
        print(f"Security error: Attempted access outside allowed directory")
        return None

    if not requested_path.exists():

    try:
        return requested_path.read_text(encoding='utf-8')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading file: {e}")
        return None

# Safe usage
base_dir: Path = Path("notes")
base_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
(base_dir / "note1.txt").write_text("Important note")

# Safe: Normal access
content = read_note(base_dir, "note1.txt")
print(f"Read: {content}")

# Unsafe: Attempted traversal (blocked)
# content = read_note(base_dir, "../../etc/passwd")
# Output: Security error: Attempted access outside allowed directory
```

> Your AI can generate paths; your job is specifying the directory structure.

#### 🚀 CoLearning Challenge (after Code Example 3.3)
Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "Generate code that creates a directory structure for 5 projects, each with 'src', 'tests', and 'docs' subdirectories.
> Then show me how to use glob() to count total Python files across all projects."

**Expected Outcome**: You'll see pathlib for scaling (creating many dirs) and glob for discovering files

#### ✨ Teaching Tip (before security section)
> Use Claude Code to explore path security: "What would happen if someone passed '../../../etc/passwd' as user input?
> Show me the problem and how to defend against it using `.resolve()` and `.is_relative_to()`."

**Practice Approach**:

**Exercise 1**: Create a nested directory structure (data/2025/11/daily) using mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
- Acceptance: All directories created, running again doesn't error
- Validation: Verify with Path.exists() checks

**Exercise 2**: List all files with specific extension in a directory using glob()
- Acceptance: Correctly identifies all .txt or .py files
- Validation: Test with mixed file types

**Exercise 3**: Implement path validation that prevents traversal attacks
- Acceptance: Blocks '../' patterns, allows normal filenames
- Validation: Test with both safe paths and attack patterns

**End-of-Lesson: Try With AI** (4 prompts):

**Prompt 1 - Remember/Understand**:
```
Ask your AI: "What is pathlib? Why is it better than using os.path or string concatenation for file paths?"

Expected Outcome: You'll understand pathlib solves cross-platform path problems elegantly.
```

**Prompt 2 - Apply**:
```
Ask your AI: "Write code that creates a notes directory with subdirectories for each month of 2025,
then lists how many directories were created."

Expected Outcome: You'll see directory creation at scale and glob pattern usage.
```

**Prompt 3 - Analyze**:
```
Ask your AI: "Compare these approaches: (1) hardcoding paths like 'data/notes/file.txt',
(2) using os.path.join(), (3) using pathlib. Which works on all operating systems and why?"

Expected Outcome: You'll understand why pathlib is the modern standard.
```

**Prompt 4 - Synthesize/Create** (cognitive closure):
```
Ask your AI: "Design a file management system that finds all notes in a directory tree,
validates they're not trying to escape the notes directory, and displays them organized by date.
What pathlib methods would you use?"

Expected Outcome: You'll see pathlib for security, organization, and practical file management patterns.
```

**Duration**: 90–120 minutes (project time)

**Application Specification**:

**Note-Taking App Features**:

1. **Menu-Driven Interface**:
   - Display main menu with options: Create Note, Read Note, Update Note, Delete Note, Search, List Notes, Exit
   - Accept user choice (1-7)
   - Execute corresponding action
   - Return to menu after each action

2. **Create Note**:
   - Prompt for title, body, category
   - Generate UUID for note ID
   - Create notes/[category]/ directory if needed
   - Save as notes/[category]/[id].json with metadata (created, modified timestamps)
   - Confirm creation

3. **Read Note**:
   - List existing notes (by category or all)
   - Prompt user to select note
   - Display title, body, category, dates
   - Return to menu

4. **Update Note**:
   - List existing notes
   - Select note to update
   - Prompt for new title/body/category
   - Save with updated modified timestamp
   - Confirm update

5. **Delete Note**:
   - List existing notes
   - Confirm deletion (safety check)
   - Delete file
   - Confirm deletion

6. **Search**:
   - Prompt for search keyword
   - Search all notes' titles and bodies
   - Display matching notes
   - Return to menu

7. **List Notes**:
   - Show all notes organized by category
   - Display count per category

8. **Exit**:
   - Graceful shutdown with goodbye message

**Data Format** (JSON per note):
```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "title": "Python Study Notes",
  "body": "Today learned about file I/O with context managers...",
  "category": "learning",
  "created": "2025-11-09T10:30:00",
  "modified": "2025-11-09T14:45:00"
}
```

**Scale**:
- Expected 10-50 notes across 3-5 categories
- No database required; file-based storage is sufficient
- Performance acceptable for interactive use

**Content Outline**:
1. **Application Architecture Introduction** (10 min) - Design overview, user flow diagram
2. **Setting Up Project Structure** (10 min) - Initialize notes/ directory, explain organization
3. **Core Functions** (40 min) - Code functions for each CRUD operation
   - get_all_notes() → list[dict]
   - save_note(note: dict) → None
   - delete_note(note_id: str) → bool
   - search_notes(keyword: str) → list[dict]
4. **Menu Loop Implementation** (20 min) - Main loop structure with user input handling
5. **Error Handling and Validation** (10 min) - Input validation, file operation error handling
6. **Testing and Refinement** (10 min) - Manual testing, edge case handling

**Code Examples** (3-4 for Capstone):

**Code Example 5.1: Project Structure and Initialization**
```python
from pathlib import Path
import uuid
import json
from datetime import datetime

# Setup
BASE_DIR: Path = Path("notes")
BASE_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

# Create default categories
CATEGORIES: list[str] = ["work", "personal", "learning"]
for category in CATEGORIES:
    (BASE_DIR / category).mkdir(exist_ok=True)

def get_note_path(category: str, note_id: str) -> Path:
    """Get path for a note, with security validation."""
    requested_path = (BASE_DIR / category / f"{note_id}.json").resolve()
    if not requested_path.is_relative_to(BASE_DIR.resolve()):
        raise ValueError(f"Security error: Invalid path")
    return requested_path

# Example: Create a new note
note_id: str = str(uuid.uuid4())
note: dict = {
    "id": note_id,
    "title": "My First Note",
    "body": "This is the body of my note.",
    "category": "learning",
    "created": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "modified": datetime.now().isoformat(),
}

note_path: Path = get_note_path("learning", note_id)
with open(note_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    json.dump(note, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)

print(f"Note saved to: {note_path}")
```
- **Purpose**: Show project initialization with security
- **Complexity**: B1 (integrating pathlib, UUID, JSON)
- **Expected Outcome**: Student sees application structure before capstone

**Code Example 5.2: CRUD Functions**

```
- **Purpose**: Show menu loop structure and input validation
- **Complexity**: B1 (orchestrating all I/O concepts)
- **Expected Outcome**: Student sees application flow connecting user input to operations

**CoLearning Elements**:

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt (at project start)
> "I'm building a note-taking app. Before I write code, what data structure should I use?
> Should each note be one file or all notes in one file? What are the tradeoffs?"

**Expected Outcome**: Student thinks through design decisions before implementation

#### 🎓 Instructor Commentary (after showing CRUD functions)
> In AI-native development, you don't memorize file paths or JSON syntax — you understand APPLICATION FLOW.
> Your job: specify what the app should do (create, read, update, delete). AI generates the file handling code.
> You validate that it works.

#### 🚀 CoLearning Challenge (during project development)
Ask your AI Co-Teacher:
> "My app is slow when I have 1000 notes—every operation loads all notes.
> How would you optimize this? What data structure would help?"

**Expected Outcome**: Student thinks about scaling and performance tradeoffs

#### ✨ Teaching Tip (during testing)
> Use Claude Code to test edge cases: "What happens if someone creates a note with title ''empty'',
> then tries to update it? Or deletes it twice? Show me the error and how to prevent it."

**Project Deliverables**:

Students will build:
1. **Main application file** (app.py or main.py) with menu loop
2. **Helper functions module** (optional) with CRUD and utility functions
3. **Data directory** (notes/) with category subdirectories
4. **Working application** that:
   - Accepts user menu input without crashing
   - Creates notes with UUID and timestamps
   - Saves/loads notes as JSON with proper encoding
   - Searches for notes by keyword
   - Updates and deletes notes
   - Returns to menu after each operation

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Application runs without crashes
- ✅ All CRUD operations work correctly
- ✅ User input is validated (no empty notes, valid menu choices)
- ✅ Notes persist between sessions (JSON files remain)
- ✅ Search finds notes by keyword
- ✅ Application handles errors gracefully (missing file, corrupted JSON)
- ✅ Code organized with functions for each operation
- ✅ Supports 10-50 notes at reasonable performance
- ✅ 80%+ of students complete capstone project

**End-of-Lesson: Try With AI** (4 prompts with capstone focus):

**Prompt 1 - Remember/Understand**:
```
Ask your AI: "Show me the overall architecture of a note-taking app.
What are the main components and how do they interact?"

Expected Outcome: You'll understand application structure before coding.
```

**Prompt 2 - Apply**:
```
Ask your AI: "Write the main menu loop that displays options 1-7 and calls different functions
based on user input. Add input validation to reject invalid choices."

Expected Outcome: You'll see how menu routing and validation work together.
```

**Prompt 3 - Analyze**:
```
Ask your AI: "I'm building a note-taking app and deciding: should I store one note per file or
all notes in one JSON file? Compare these approaches. Which is better and why?"

Expected Outcome: You'll understand data organization tradeoffs.
```

**Prompt 4 - Synthesize/Create** (cognitive closure):
```
Ask your AI: "Design a complete Note-Taking app with Create/Read/Update/Delete operations.
Walk me through the application flow: user sees menu → selects option → app responds → returns to menu.
What error cases must we handle? What does the data structure look like?"

Expected Outcome: You've integrated all I/O concepts into a cohesive, production-quality application
demonstrating mastery of Chapter 22. Ready for file-based applications in Chapters 23+.
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Student builds working Note-Taking App with all CRUD operations
- Application persists data to JSON files in category directories
- User input is validated and errors handled gracefully
- Application is scalable (10-50 notes) and maintainable
- 80%+ of students complete capstone project
- Students can explain architectural decisions

---

## 🏗️ Scaffolding Strategy

**A2 → A2-B1 → B1 Progression**:

1. **Lesson 1 (A2)**: Simple operations with guidance
   - input() is straightforward
   - Type conversion has expected errors (ValueError)
   - F-strings are familiar from Chapter 16
   - Validation requires try/except (Chapter 21)

2. **Lesson 2 (A2-B1)**: Add resource management complexity
   - Context managers are NEW (with statement pattern)
   - Multiple file modes introduced
   - Multiple reading methods (choose appropriate)
   - Exception types vary (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, IOError)

3. **Lesson 3 (B1)**: Object-oriented thinking with paths
   - Path objects are new (not strings)
   - Immutability concept (Path()/resolve() return new objects)
   - Methods for files vs directories
   - Security thinking (traversal prevention) is sophisticated

4. **Lesson 4 (B1)**: Data format complexity
   - CSV module is new (csv.reader vs csv.DictReader choice)
   - JSON serialization/deserialization is inverse concept
   - Encoding considerations (UTF-8, ensure_ascii=False)
   - Format selection requires understanding of use cases

5. **Lesson 5 (B1)**: Architectural thinking
   - Students orchestrate multiple I/O concepts
   - Data structure design (one file per note vs single file)
   - Application flow (menu loop, CRUD dispatch)
   - Error handling at multiple levels
   - Scaling thinking (handles 10-50 notes)

**Cognitive Load Management**:
- Each lesson introduces ONE major new concept (input→file→path→format→integration)
- Related skills grouped in same lesson
- Spiral learning: each lesson builds on prior without overwhelming
- Practice exercises validate mastery before moving forward

---

## 🔗 Integration Points

**Within Chapter 22**:
- Lesson 1 input validation → Lesson 5 menu input validation
- Lesson 2 file operations → Lesson 5 note persistence
- Lesson 3 path organization → Lesson 5 notes/[category]/[id].json structure
- Lesson 4 JSON format → Lesson 5 note storage format

**Bridge to Chapter 23** (Math, DateTime, Calendar):
- Lesson 5 uses datetime.now().isoformat() for timestamps
- Chapter 23 will teach advanced datetime operations
- Path operations from Lesson 3 used for file timestamping

**Prior Chapters**:
- Chapter 13: Basic print(), variable basics
- Chapter 14: Data types (understanding dicts, lists for JSON/CSV)
- Chapter 15: Type conversion (int(), float() for input validation)
- Chapter 16: F-strings (formatting output)
- Chapter 17: Loops (iterating files, menu loop)
- Chapter 18: Dicts (CSV DictReader, JSON objects)
- Chapter 19: Collections understanding
- Chapter 20: Functions (code organization in Lesson 5)
- Chapter 21: Exception handling (file errors, JSON errors)

---

## ✅ Validation Strategy

**For Technical Chapter**, students demonstrate understanding through:

1. **Console I/O** (Lesson 1):
   - Exercise: Input validation program that doesn't crash
   - Try With AI: Design quiz program structure

2. **File I/O** (Lesson 2):
   - Exercise: Read/write files with error handling
   - Try With AI: File backup program with format conversion

3. **Pathlib** (Lesson 3):
   - Exercise: Create directory structures, list files, validate paths
   - Try With AI: File management system with security

4. **Structured Formats** (Lesson 4):
   - Exercise: CSV→JSON conversion with error handling
   - Try With AI: Data import system with validation

5. **Capstone** (Lesson 5):
   - Project: Complete Note-Taking App with all CRUD operations
   - Assessment: App persists data, handles errors, supports 10-50 notes
   - Demonstration: Explain architectural decisions

**Success Metrics**:
- 75%+ can write input validation code without crashes
- 80%+ can use context managers for file safety
- 75%+ can work with pathlib for cross-platform paths
- 70%+ can read/write CSV and JSON correctly
- 85%+ can build complete Note-Taking App capstone
- 80%+ report confidence building file-based CLI applications

---

## 🎯 Architectural Decisions

**Decision 1: Five 75-90 minute lessons vs. Four longer lessons**
- **Rationale**: A2-B1 students need frequent breaks and practice cycles. Five lessons with 75-90 min duration allows more scaffolding checkpoints. Four long lessons would exceed cognitive load limits and reduce engagement.
- **ADR Candidate**: Yes — "Chapter 22 Lesson Structure: Five Lesson Pattern for I/O Mastery" (determines baseline for similar Part 4 chapters)

**Decision 2: File-Per-Note vs. Single File for Capstone**
- **Rationale**: File-per-note approach teaches pathlib directory organization, demonstrates scalability beyond list-in-memory, and prevents large JSON file parsing overhead. Single-file approach simpler but pedagogically weaker.
- **ADR Candidate**: Yes — "Note-Taking App Architecture: File-Per-Note Pattern" (establishes scaling pattern for later chapters)

**Decision 3: Menu Loop in Main App vs. Functions**
- **Rationale**: Capstone shows menu loop in main app with separate CRUD functions. This teaches separation of concerns (UI logic vs data logic) essential for Chapter 24 OOP.
- **ADR Candidate**: No — Standard pattern, not significant deviation

**Decision 4: JSON with ensure_ascii=False instead of CSV for notes**
- **Rationale**: JSON better supports nested metadata (id, title, body, category, timestamps). CSV is flat and harder to extend. Teaches students when JSON is appropriate.
- **ADR Candidate**: No — Technical choice, not architectural impact

**ADR Suggestions**:
1. Run `/sp.adr 22-lesson-structure-five-vs-four` to document lesson count decision
2. Run `/sp.adr 22-capstone-architecture-file-per-note` to document scalability pattern

## 📋 Dependencies and Risks

**Chapter Dependencies**:
- ✅ Chapter 21 (Exception Handling) — REQUIRED, foundational for file error handling
- ✅ Chapter 20 (Functions) — REQUIRED, needed for Lesson 5 function organization
- ✅ Chapter 17 (Loops) — REQUIRED, for file iteration and menu loops
- ✅ Chapters 13-19 — REQUIRED, general Python foundations

**Risk 1: Lesson 2 (File I/O) Complexity**
- **Issue**: Context managers (with statement) are conceptually challenging for A2 students; context manager syntax unfamiliar
- **Impact**: Could cause 15-20% of students to struggle with file safety concepts
- **Mitigation**:
  - Lead with explicit "Why context managers matter" explanation (resource cleanup, file corruption prevention)
  - Provide "before/after" comparison: manual close vs with statement
  - Emphasize "syntax is cheap; safety is gold" in CoLearning Commentary
  - Offer extended practice exercises with and without context managers

**Risk 2: Lesson 3 (Pathlib) Abstraction**
- **Issue**: Path objects as first-class values (immutable, methods) require OOP thinking students haven't formally learned (Chapter 24)
- **Impact**: Could cause confusion about `.resolve()`, `.is_relative_to()`, path semantics
- **Mitigation**:
  - Introduce with "Path objects are Python's smart tool for paths" (tool framing, not OOP jargon)
  - Show pathlib before os.path — students won't compare unfavorably
  - Use "method chains" language ("path.resolve() returns NEW path") instead of OOP terminology
  - Defer deep OOP explanation to Chapter 24

**Risk 3: Lesson 4 (CSV/JSON) Format Concepts**
- **Issue**: CSV headers vs data rows, JSON serialization/deserialization are subtle. Students may confuse csv.reader (tuples) with csv.DictReader (dicts)
- **Impact**: Could cause 10-15% to struggle with format selection and header handling
- **Mitigation**:
  - Show direct comparison: csv.reader vs csv.DictReader side-by-side with same data
  - Provide "when to use each" decision table
  - Emphasize DictReader for practical use (headers as keys more convenient)
  - Multiple practice exercises with both approaches

**Risk 4: Lesson 5 (Capstone Scope)**
- **Issue**: Complete Note-Taking App is ambitious for B1 students; risk of incomplete projects or feature creep
- **Impact**: Could cause 20-30% to not finish or feel overwhelmed
- **Mitigation**:
  - Provide starter code skeleton (menu loop, function stubs)
  - Break into incremental steps: (1) Menu only, (2) Create note, (3) Read note, (4) Update/Delete, (5) Search
  - Define MVP (Minimum Viable Product): CRUD only, no advanced features
  - Offer "extension ideas" for B1+ students (categories, search, timestamps)
  - Provide reference solution with explanations

**Risk 5: Time Constraints**
- **Issue**: 5-6 hours total; Lesson 5 capstone 90-120 minutes could pressure students in live classroom
- **Impact**: Could cause incomplete capstone or skipped practice exercises
- **Mitigation**:
  - Position Lesson 5 as "homework/project time" with optional in-class checkpoint
  - Provide complete capstone code as reference for students who run short on time
  - Emphasize that attempting project is success (even if incomplete); learning happens in trying

**Mitigation Summary**:
- Lesson 2: Extra explanation and before/after examples for context managers
- Lesson 3: Tool framing (not OOP jargon), side-by-side comparisons
- Lesson 4: Direct format comparison, decision tables, multiple exercises
- Lesson 5: Starter code, MVP definition, incremental steps, reference solution
- Overall: Provide "Try With AI" prompts that can scaffold struggling students

## 📚 Next Steps

After this plan is approved:

1. **Quality Gate**: Run `/sp.analyze` to validate cross-artifact consistency (spec ↔ plan alignment)
2. **Architecture Review**: Review ADR suggestions above; run `/sp.adr [decision-title]` for significant decisions
3. **Task Decomposition**: Run `/sp.tasks` to create implementation checklist with acceptance criteria
4. **Implementation**: Use `/sp.implement` or lesson-writer agent to generate lesson files from plan
5. **Validation**: Technical and content review to ensure:
   - All skills metadata included in lesson frontmatter
   - Cognitive load verified (max 5-7 concepts per lesson)
   - CoLearning elements distributed throughout (not just at end)
   - "Try With AI" sections properly formatted with Bloom's progression
   - Code examples tested and working with Python 3.14+
   - Type hints on all functions
   - pathlib used instead of os.path
   - context managers for all file operations
   - UTF-8 encoding explicit for text files
