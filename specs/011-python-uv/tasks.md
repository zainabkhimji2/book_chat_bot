# Tasks: Chapter 11 - Python UV: The Fastest Python Package Manager

**Feature**: Chapter content teaching AI-Driven UV workflows (intent-first, AI executes commands)
**Input**: Design documents from `specs/011-python-uv/`
**Prerequisites**: spec.md (user stories), plan.md (lesson structure)

**Tests**: No automated tests for educational content. Validation via technical-reviewer and manual testing of all UV commands.

**Organization**: Tasks are organized by lesson (maps to user stories in spec.md) to enable independent writing and review of each lesson.

---

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all lesson writing
- **Lessons (Phases 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - Lessons MUST be written sequentially (L1→L2→L3→L4→L5→L6) due to prerequisite flow
  - Each lesson builds on concepts from previous lessons
- **Integration (Phase 9)**: Depends on all 6 lessons being complete
- **Validation (Phase 10)**: Depends on Integration phase completion

### Lesson Dependencies

- **Lesson 1 (Why UV)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other lessons
- **Lesson 2 (Installation)**: Depends on Lesson 1 (motivation established) - Readers install UV
- **Lesson 3 (First Project)**: Depends on Lesson 2 (UV installed) - Readers create project
- **Lesson 4 (Dependencies)**: Depends on Lesson 3 (project created) - Readers add/manage packages
- **Lesson 5 (Running Code)**: Depends on Lesson 4 (dependencies installed) - Readers execute scripts
- **Lesson 6 (Collaboration)**: Depends on Lessons 3-5 (project management skills) - Readers share projects

### Within Each Lesson

- Opening sections before hands-on examples
- Conceptual understanding before command execution
- Basic prompts before advanced scenarios
- "Try With AI" section always last in lesson

### Parallel Opportunities

- Setup tasks (T002, T003, T004) can run in parallel
- Foundational tasks (T008, T009, T010, T011) can run in parallel (diagrams)
- Platform verification (T025, T026 in Lesson 2) can run in parallel
- Command testing (T086, T087, T088 in Phase 9) can run in parallel across platforms

---

## Parallel Example: Lesson 4 Implementation

```bash
# Task T046-T048 (conceptual sections) can be written in parallel by different writers:
git checkout -b lesson-4-concepts
# Writer A: T046 (What Are Dependencies?)
# Writer B: T047 (Adding Dependencies)
# Writer C: T048 (Dev vs Production)

# Task T049-T055 (prompt-response examples) can be written in parallel after concepts complete:
git checkout -b lesson-4-examples
# Writer A: T049 (dev dependencies example)
# Writer B: T052 (update dependencies example)
# Writer C: T054 (remove dependencies example)

# Sequential after examples: T056-T059 (integration and proofing)
```

## Notes for Implementation

**AI-Driven Development Pattern**:
Every UV task MUST follow the 4-part pattern:
1. **Prompt**: Reader's natural language intent to Claude Code/Gemini CLI
2. **Response**: AI's command with explanation
3. **Output**: Expected terminal output
4. **Teaching**: AI's follow-up explanation (concepts, not syntax)

**Complexity Tier Compliance**:
- Max 7 new concepts per lesson section
- AI as primary command executor (students focus on understanding, not memorization)
- Beginner-friendly language (Grade 7+ reading level)
- Real-world scenarios (team collaboration, production deployment)

**Testing Requirements**:
- All commands MUST be tested on Windows PowerShell, macOS, Linux
- Document platform-specific variations
- Verify all error scenarios are reproducible
- Test with latest UV version (as of writing date)

**Cross-References**:
- Chapter 5 (Claude Code) and Chapter 6 (Gemini CLI) - AI CLI tools
- Chapter 7 (Bash Essentials) - terminal competency
- Chapter 8 (Git & GitHub) - collaboration workflow (Lesson 6)
- Chapter 12 (Introduction to Python) - next chapter uses UV projects

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] All lessons have YAML frontmatter with skills metadata
- [ ] All prompt-response examples complete and tested
- [ ] All diagrams created and render correctly
- [ ] All cross-references valid
- [ ] Chapter passes technical-reviewer validation
- [ ] Docusaurus build successful
- [ ] Visual inspection complete
