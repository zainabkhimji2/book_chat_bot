## Lesson Architecture

### Lesson 1: Why UV? Understanding Modern Python Package Management

**Objective**: Recognize the problems UV solves (speed, unified tooling, reproducibility) and evaluate when to use UV vs. traditional tools (pip/poetry/conda) in familiar project contexts

**Skills Taught**:
- **Evaluate Python Package Managers** — A2 (Foundation) — Conceptual — Student can explain "why UV exists" and identify which tool to use for common project scenarios (personal script vs. team project vs. data science)
- **Recognize Speed Benefits** — A1 (Foundation) — Technical — Student can identify the value of 10-100x faster package installation in their workflow and give examples of when speed matters

**Key Concepts** (max 7):
1. Package manager purpose (installing/managing Python libraries)
2. The Python tooling fragmentation problem (pip, venv, virtualenv, pipenv, poetry, conda)
3. UV's unified approach (one tool, multiple functions)
4. Speed advantage (Rust implementation = 10-100x faster)
5. Industry backing and adoption (Astral, creators of Ruff)
6. When to use UV vs. pip/poetry/conda (decision-making framework)
7. AI-Driven Development approach to UV (intent expression over command memorization)

**Prerequisites**: 
- Chapter 7 (Bash Essentials) - basic terminal competency
- Chapter 5 or 6 (Claude Code/Gemini CLI) - AI CLI tool installed

### Note: Advanced features intentionally omitted

Advanced UV features (Python version management, standalone script execution, global tool installation, and workspace management) are intentionally omitted from this chapter to keep the material focused and beginner-friendly. These topics are valuable but belong in an advanced follow-up chapter where students have a stronger foundation in Python and project workflows.

If you'd like, I can draft a short advanced-appendix or a separate chapter plan covering these features later.
- **Use Case Matrix**: When to use each advanced feature (decision guide)
- **Learning Resources**: Official docs, GitHub, community forums

**Practice Approach**:
- **Exploratory Exercise**: "Find 3 UV features we haven't covered by asking AI"
- **Hands-On Experiments**: Try Python version switching, standalone scripts, or global tools
- **Project Application**: Apply one advanced feature to student's own project
- **Resource Navigation**: Find answers in official UV docs (with AI as guide)

**End-of-Lesson: Try With AI** — Claude Code or Gemini CLI
- Prompt 1: "Install Python 3.12 and pin it for this project"
- Prompt 2: "Can I run a standalone Python script with inline dependencies? Show me how."
- Prompt 3: "Install [tool-name] globally with UV (not in a specific project)"
- Prompt 4: "Start a Python REPL with [packages] temporarily available for testing"
- Prompt 5: "What advanced UV features would help with [my-specific-use-case]?"
- Expected Outcomes: Discovered advanced features, applied at least one, comfortable with just-in-time learning
- Safety Note: Experiment in test projects first; understand feature implications before production use

## Chapter-Specific Considerations

### Pedagogical Approach: AI-First Development

**Core Teaching Pattern** (applied in ALL 6 lessons):

1. **Intent Expression**: Student describes what they want ("Create a simple web-client project that uses `requests`")
2. **AI Translation**: Claude Code/Gemini CLI provides command + explanation
3. **Conceptual Understanding**: Student focuses on "what" and "why," not "how to type command"
4. **Verification**: AI confirms success, student validates understanding
5. **Teaching Follow-Up**: AI explains what just happened (deepens learning)

**This is NOT**:
- ❌ "Here's the `uv init` command, memorize it"
- ❌ "Read the UV docs, then practice commands"
- ❌ "Learn command flags and options"

**This IS**:
- ✅ "Tell AI what you want, AI provides command, you understand the concept"
- ✅ "AI is your interactive documentation and teacher"
- ✅ "Focus on problem-solving, not syntax memorization"

### Complexity Tier Application (Intermediate - Part 4)

**Beginner Scaffolding We DON'T Use** (This is Part 4, not Parts 1-3):
- ❌ Max 2 options only (we present UV vs. pip vs. poetry vs. conda)
- ❌ AI makes ALL decisions (students evaluate tradeoffs)
- ❌ Max 5 concepts per lesson (we use up to 7)
- ❌ Oversimplified scenarios (we use real team collaboration)

**Intermediate Scaffolding We DO Use**:
- ✅ 3-4 tool options with decision framework
- ✅ Max 7 concepts per lesson (respects A2-B1 cognitive load)
- ✅ Students make guided decisions (AI as advisor, not decision-maker)
- ✅ Real-world complexity (team workflows, production deployment)
- ✅ Troubleshooting scenarios (not just "happy path")

### Constitutional Alignment Checklist

**AI-First Teaching** (Principle 1):
- ✅ Every lesson uses AI CLI tool (Claude Code/Gemini CLI)
- ✅ Every code example shows prompt → response → output → teaching pattern
- ✅ AI positioned as co-reasoning partner, not autocomplete
- ✅ Traditional "manual commands first" explicitly rejected

**Spec-First Methodology** (Principle 2):
- ✅ Chapter follows Business Goals → Success Evals → Requirements structure
- ✅ Evals defined before detailed content (quiz, hands-on, real-world application)
- ✅ All examples include the intent (specification) that produced them

**Modern Python Standards** (Principle 3):
- ✅ UV taught as modern standard (vs. legacy pip/virtualenv)
- ✅ pyproject.toml emphasized (vs. requirements.txt)
- ✅ Python 3.13+ context (modern tooling for modern Python)
- N/A Type hints (no Python code written in this chapter)

**Validation-First Safety** (Principle 4):
- ✅ "Try With AI" sections include safety notes
- ✅ Students validate AI outputs, not blindly trust
- ✅ Troubleshooting skills taught (error diagnosis with AI)
- ✅ "Understand before executing" emphasized

**Progressive Complexity** (Principle 5):
- ✅ Lesson 1 is conceptual only (easiest)
- ✅ Lessons 2-5 build skills progressively
- ✅ Lesson 6 integrates prior skills (collaboration)
- ✅ Advanced features are deferred to a later chapter or appendix (keeps this chapter beginner-friendly)

**Domain Skills Integration**:
- ✅ Learning Objectives (Bloom's taxonomy in every lesson objective)
- ✅ Concept Scaffolding (max 7 concepts, progressive complexity)
- ✅ Assessment Builder (quiz + hands-on + real-world validation)
- ✅ AI-Collaborate Teaching (AI-first pattern throughout)
- ✅ Technical Clarity (complex concepts explained in plain language)
- ✅ Exercise Designer (hands-on activities in every lesson)

## Follow-Ups & Risks

### Identified Risks

1. **Risk**: Students skip installation troubleshooting (Lesson 2) and encounter "command not found" later
   - **Mitigation**: Make troubleshooting section engaging (error scenarios as puzzles to solve with AI)
   - **Validation**: Include troubleshooting scenario in end-of-chapter assessment

2. **Risk**: Students don't understand virtual environments (Lesson 3) and get confused when dependencies "disappear" outside project
   - **Mitigation**: Strong analogy (separate toolboxes), visual diagram, demonstration of isolation
   - **Validation**: "Teach back" check - student explains isolation to AI

3. **Risk**: Chapter teaches tooling BEFORE Python syntax (novel sequencing may confuse some students)
   - **Mitigation**: Clear framing: "Professional workflow = setup tools first, code second"
   - **Validation**: Opening of Chapter 12 explicitly references this chapter and reinforces the workflow

4. **Risk**: Advanced features could feel overwhelming for beginners
   - **Mitigation**: Advanced features omitted from this chapter; deferred to an advanced-appendix or follow-up chapter
   - **Validation**: Assessment focuses on core workflows (Lessons 1-6) only

5. **Risk**: Students with prior Python experience (pip/virtualenv) may resist UV
   - **Mitigation**: Lesson 1 decision framework validates pip/poetry for specific use cases (not "UV always wins")
   - **Validation**: Include comparison scenarios showing when pip is still appropriate

### Next Steps After This Chapter

**Immediate** (Chapter 12):
- Begin Python syntax teaching using UV projects created in this chapter
- Reinforce UV workflow (students already have projects ready)
- Reference this chapter when installing new packages ("Remember Lesson 4?")

**Part 4 Continuation** (Chapters 13-29):
- All Python chapters use UV for dependency management
- Students build progressively complex projects (all with UV structure)
- UV becomes invisible infrastructure (focus shifts to Python concepts)

**Part 5 Integration** (Chapters 30-33):
- Spec-Driven Development examples use UV projects
- Specification includes dependency requirements (managed with UV)
- Professional workflow: spec → plan → UV project setup → implementation

**Production Readiness** (Parts 10-13):
- Lesson 6 collaboration skills scale to production deployment
- UV lockfiles ensure reproducible production environments
- Docker images use UV for fast, reliable dependency installation

## Implementation Notes for Lesson Writers

### Tone & Voice

- **Conversational but professional**: "Let's create your first UV project" (not "The user shall initialize")
- **Encouraging**: "You just created a production-ready project in 30 seconds!"
- **No jargon without explanation**: First mention of "virtual environment" includes plain-language definition
- **AI-partnership framing**: "You and Claude Code will..." (not "Claude Code will do this for you")

### Visual Elements Required

- **Lesson 1**: Timing comparison chart (pip vs. UV), decision matrix table
- **Lesson 2**: Installation flow diagram, platform-specific command variations
- **Lesson 3**: Project structure tree (annotated), pyproject.toml annotated
- **Lesson 4**: Dependency tree diagram, before/after pyproject.toml comparison
- **Lesson 5**: Environment isolation diagram (project A vs. B)
- **Lesson 6**: Collaboration workflow (Developer A → Git → Developer B)

### Prompt-Response Pattern Template

**Every UV task example MUST include**:

```markdown
**Reader Prompt to [Claude Code/Gemini CLI]**:
[Exact intent-based prompt]

**AI Response**:
[Command with inline comments explaining each part]

**Expected Terminal Output**:
[Actual output students will see]

**AI Teaching Follow-Up**:
[Explanation of what just happened, why it matters, connections to concepts]
```

### Safety & Ethics Checks

- **Installation**: Verify installation source (official Astral site)
- **Dependencies**: Check package reputation before installing
- **Execution**: Understand scripts before running
- **Collaboration**: Review lockfile changes before committing
- **Production**: Test in staging before production deployment

### Accessibility Requirements

- **Reading Level**: Grade 7-8 (Flesch-Kincaid)
- **Technical Terms**: Defined on first use (with plain-language analogy)
- **Code Examples**: Complete (no "..." or implied steps)
- **Visual Alternatives**: All diagrams have text descriptions
- **Pacing**: 5-7 minute reading sections with visual breaks
