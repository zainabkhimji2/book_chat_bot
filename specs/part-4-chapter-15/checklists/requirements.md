# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 15 - Operators, Keywords, and Variables

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT students learn, not HOW lessons are implemented
  - ✅ Python version specified as requirement (3.14+), not implementation detail
  - ✅ Type hints shown as teaching requirement, not implementation choice

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - ✅ All success criteria connect to student learning outcomes and business goals
  - ✅ User stories written from student perspective ("As a beginner Python learner...")
  - ✅ Evals-first approach ties content to measurable learning objectives

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - ✅ Plain language explanations throughout (e.g., "Operators are the verbs in Python's language")
  - ✅ Avoids jargon in user stories and success criteria
  - ✅ Technical terms defined when introduced (e.g., "Operand: A value or variable that an operator acts upon")

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - ✅ User Scenarios & Testing (5 prioritized user stories)
  - ✅ Requirements (36 functional requirements covering operators, keywords, AI-Native Learning)
  - ✅ Success Criteria (7 measurable evals with business goal connections)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

  - ✅ User questions already answered (Q1: core operators only, Q2: 4 operators + keywords)

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - ✅ FR-001 through FR-036 are specific and verifiable
  - ✅ Examples: "MUST teach arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)" is testable by content review

  - ✅ SC-003: 70%+ identify bugs (bug-finding exercise scoring)
  - ✅ SC-004: 90%+ recognize keywords (multiple-choice quiz)
  - ✅ SC-005: 75%+ ask productive AI questions (prompt quality rubric)
  - ✅ SC-006: 80%+ complete all lessons (platform analytics)
  - ✅ SC-007: Grade 7-8 reading level (automated Flesch-Kincaid scoring)

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - ✅ All SCs describe STUDENT OUTCOMES, not system internals
  - ✅ No mention of specific testing frameworks, databases, or tools in success criteria
  - ✅ Measurement methods mentioned but not implementation tech (e.g., "platform analytics" not "Google Analytics API")

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - ✅ User Story 1 (Arithmetic): 8 acceptance scenarios
  - ✅ User Story 2 (Comparison): 6 acceptance scenarios
  - ✅ User Story 3 (Logical): 5 acceptance scenarios
  - ✅ User Story 4 (Assignment): 4 acceptance scenarios
  - ✅ User Story 5 (Keywords): 4 acceptance scenarios
  - ✅ Total: 27 acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - ✅ Division by zero (ZeroDivisionError)
  - ✅ Type mixing in operations (TypeError)
  - ✅ Float precision (0.1 + 0.2 quirks)
  - ✅ Boolean operators with non-boolean values (truthiness)
  - ✅ Operator precedence (PEMDAS)
  - ✅ Keyword case sensitivity

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - ✅ "Out of Scope" section explicitly lists excluded content
  - ✅ 11 specific operator types/concepts excluded with rationale
  - ✅ Teaching approaches excluded (formal specs, academic theory)
  - ✅ Implementation details excluded (IDE setup, debugging tools)

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - ✅ Hard dependencies: Chapters 12-14 (Python installed, data types understood)
  - ✅ Soft dependencies: Chapters 1-11 (AIDD context helpful)
  - ✅ Future dependencies: Chapters 17-25 (build on operator knowledge)
  - ✅ Assumptions: 4 categories (prior knowledge, learning context, content delivery, defaults)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - ✅ FR-001 to FR-009: Operator/keyword coverage (verifiable by content review against spec)
  - ✅ FR-010 to FR-018: AI-Native Learning pattern and lesson structure (verifiable by template compliance)
  - ✅ FR-019 to FR-027: Content constraints (verifiable by negative testing - what's excluded)
  - ✅ FR-028 to FR-032: Python standards (verifiable by code execution and linting)
  - ✅ FR-033 to FR-036: Capstone project (verifiable by project presence and scope)

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - ✅ P1 (Arithmetic operators): Most foundational, immediate utility
  - ✅ P2 (Comparison operators): Essential for decision-making (Ch 17 prep)
  - ✅ P3 (Logical operators): Complex conditions building on comparisons
  - ✅ P4 (Assignment operators): Efficiency and readability improvement
  - ✅ P5 (Keywords): Error prevention and language understanding
  - ✅ Priorities justified with "Why this priority" explanations

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - ✅ All 7 success criteria have quantitative targets (70-90% thresholds)
  - ✅ Measurement methods specified for each SC (quiz, exercise tracking, rubric scoring, analytics)
  - ✅ Business goal connection explicit (job-readiness, debugging skills, completion rates, accessibility)
  - ✅ SCs align with user stories (comprehension, skill acquisition, validation, keywords, AI partnership, engagement, accessibility)

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - ✅ Specification describes WHAT to teach, not HOW lessons are authored
  - ✅ Python 3.14+ is a requirement/constraint, not leaked implementation
  - ✅ AI tools (Claude Code/Gemini CLI) specified as student tools, not lesson delivery mechanism
  - ✅ Learning platform analytics mentioned as measurement, not as part of chapter content

## Notes

**Validation Summary**: ✅ ALL CHECKLIST ITEMS PASS

**Strengths**:
1. **Evals-First Approach**: Success criteria defined BEFORE requirements, with clear business goal connections
2. **Ruthless Filtering**: Out of Scope section explicitly excludes 11+ concepts (identity operators, membership operators, bitwise, walrus, etc.) with pedagogical rationale
3. **Cognitive Load Respect**: 5 concepts maximum enforced (4 operator types + keywords), spread across 5 lessons
4. **AI-Native Learning Integration**: 36 functional requirements include 14 specifically for AI partnership pattern
5. **Measurable Success**: All 7 SCs have quantitative targets (70-90%) and measurement methods
6. **Priority Justification**: Each of 5 user stories includes "Why this priority" and "Independent Test" sections
7. **Edge Case Coverage**: 6 edge cases identified with learning opportunity framing (errors = teaching moments)
8. **No Clarification Needed**: User decisions (Q1: core operators, Q2: 4 types + keywords) resolved upfront

**Quality Indicators**:
- 27 acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format (thorough testability)
- 36 functional requirements across 5 categories (comprehensive coverage)
- 7 measurable success criteria with business goals (evals-first)
- 4 assumption categories documented (design decisions transparent)
- 7 risks identified with probability/impact/mitigation (proactive risk management)

**Readiness for Next Phase**: ✅ READY FOR /sp.clarify (though likely no clarifications needed given thoroughness)

**Recommendation**: Proceed directly to /sp.plan after user approval. Specification is complete, unambiguous, and aligned with constitutional AI-Native Learning principles.
