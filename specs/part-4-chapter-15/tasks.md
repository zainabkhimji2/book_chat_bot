## Risk Mitigation & Dependencies

**Key Risks**:

| Risk | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-----------|-------|
| R1: Code examples don't run on Python 3.14+ | Test all examples on Python 3.14 before finalizing | Lesson writer |
| R2: Type hints missing from examples | Automated grep check for `: type` and `-> type` | QA/reviewer |
| R3: "Try With AI" prompts are vague | Use examples from plan.md; ensure expected outcomes clear | Lesson writer |
| R4: Lesson exceeds 5 concept cognitive limit | Count concepts against plan.md; split if necessary | Lesson writer |
| R5: Reading level too high for target audience | Automated Flesch-Kincaid check; rewrite complex sentences | Editor |
| R6: Capstone project too complex for A1-A2 students | Test with beginner; simplify if needed; provide function-free version | Lesson writer |
| R7: Chapter doesn't prepare for Chapter 17 | Ensure Lessons 2-3 mention if/while/for coming; cross-ref in Prompts 4 | Lesson writer |

**Dependencies**:
- [ ] Chapter 14 (Data Types) must be complete and stable (✅ already validated as of Nov 8, 2025)
- [ ] Constitution v3.0.2 requirements understood (AI-Native Learning pattern, graduated complexity)
- [ ] Output style guide (`.claude/output-styles/lesson.md`) available for reference

## Timeline & Effort Estimation

**Total Estimated Effort**: 45–55 story points (approximately 36–44 hours)

**Phase Breakdown**:
1. **Phase 1 (Content Structure)**: 57–93h per lesson ≈ 14–23h per lesson × 5 = 70–115h
   - *Adjusted: 48–56h* (consolidated estimates, some tasks overlap)

2. **Phase 2 (Practice & Validation)**: 10–14h

3. **Phase 3 (Review & Integration)**: 10–14h

4. **Phase 4 (Technical Review & Publication)**: 8–12h

5. **Phase 5 (Content Validation & Integration)**: 6–10h

**Total**: 82–106h (approximately 2–2.5 weeks at 40 hours/week)

**Recommended Pacing**:
- Week 1: Lessons 1-2 (Phase 1 content creation)
- Week 2: Lessons 3-4 (Phase 1 content creation)
- Week 3: Lesson 5 + capstone (Phase 1), Phase 2-3 reviews
- Week 4: Phase 4 technical review, Phase 5 publication prep

## Follow-Ups & Next Steps

**Upon Completion of This Chapter**:

1. **Chapter 16 Planning** (Strings and Type Casting)
   - Builds on Chapter 15's operators (string concatenation with +)
   - Uses str() type conversion (casting)
   - Reference: Assume Chapter 15 operators are foundational

2. **Chapter 17 Planning** (Control Flow and Loops)
   - Uses comparison operators (if, while conditions)
   - Uses logical operators (complex conditions)
   - Uses assignment operators (+=  in loop counters)
   - Reference: Chapter 15 as prerequisite vocabulary

3. **Quality Assurance Feedback Loop**
   - Technical reviewer flags any issues (code, accessibility, structure)
   - Lesson writer addresses feedback within 2 business days
   - Iterate until review passes

4. **Publication & Analytics**
   - Track completion rates (SC-006 eval)
   - Monitor student feedback on difficulty/clarity
   - Adjust Lesson 5 capstone complexity if needed based on data

## Notes for Lesson Writer

**Before Starting**:

1. Read the approved spec (`specs/part-4-chapter-15/spec.md`) fully
2. Review this plan (`specs/part-4-chapter-15/plan.md`) for lesson structure
3. Reference Chapter 14 plan to understand prerequisite expectations
4. Review `.claude/output-styles/lesson.md` for YAML frontmatter and formatting

**Key Reminders**:

- **Type hints are not optional** — every variable and function has type hint
- **"Try With AI" is the closure** — no summaries, key takeaways, or checklists after
- **Part 4 language** — say "describe intent" not "specify requirements" (Part 5+ terminology)
- **Errors are learning opportunities** — ZeroDivisionError, TypeError are intentional demos
- **Validation-first** — every lesson teaches students to verify results with type()
- **Concrete examples** — use small numbers (10, 3) that students can mentally verify
- **Four prompts per lesson** — Concept → Application → Edge Case → Synthesis progression

**Status**: ✅ Ready for Lesson Writer Execution
**Next Action**: Assign to lesson-writer subagent; proceed with Phase 1 (Lesson 1 content creation)
**Quality Gate**: All acceptance criteria must be met before marking chapter complete
**Estimated Completion**: 2–3 weeks (depending on revision cycles)
