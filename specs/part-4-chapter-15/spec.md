## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Learn to Perform Math Operations (Priority: P1)

**As a beginner Python learner**, I want to **understand and use arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)** so that **I can perform calculations in my programs**.

**Why this priority**: Arithmetic is the most foundational and immediately useful operator category. Students can write calculator-like programs from day 1. This is the "hello world" of data manipulation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having students write a simple calculator that performs all 7 arithmetic operations and validates results by asking AI "Is this result correct?"

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have two numbers (e.g., 10 and 3), **When** I use the + operator, **Then** I get 13 and understand it adds values
2. **Given** I have two numbers (e.g., 10 and 3), **When** I use the - operator, **Then** I get 7 and understand it subtracts
3. **Given** I have two numbers (e.g., 10 and 3), **When** I use the * operator, **Then** I get 30 and understand it multiplies
4. **Given** I have two numbers (e.g., 10 and 3), **When** I use the / operator, **Then** I get 3.333... (float) and understand it divides
5. **Given** I have two numbers (e.g., 10 and 3), **When** I use the // operator, **Then** I get 3 (integer) and understand it does floor division
6. **Given** I have two numbers (e.g., 10 and 3), **When** I use the % operator, **Then** I get 1 (remainder) and understand modulus
7. **Given** I have two numbers (e.g., 10 and 3), **When** I use the ** operator, **Then** I get 1000 (10 cubed) and understand exponentiation
8. **Given** I have int and float types, **When** I perform arithmetic operations, **Then** I can use type() to verify result types and ask AI why types change

---

### User Story 2 - Make Decisions with Comparisons (Priority: P2)

**As a beginner Python learner**, I want to **understand and use comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)** so that **I can compare values and make decisions in my programs**.

**Why this priority**: Comparisons are essential for all conditional logic (covered in Ch 17). This chapter introduces the concept without requiring if/else statements yet - students just see True/False results.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having students compare different values and predict/verify True/False results, then ask AI to explain edge cases like comparing int to float.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have two values, **When** I use == operator, **Then** I get True if equal, False otherwise
2. **Given** I have two values, **When** I use != operator, **Then** I get True if not equal, False if equal
3. **Given** I have two numbers, **When** I use > or < operators, **Then** I get True/False based on magnitude comparison
4. **Given** I have two numbers, **When** I use >= or <= operators, **Then** I get True/False including equality case
5. **Given** I compare int to float (e.g., 5 == 5.0), **When** using == operator, **Then** I understand Python compares values not types
6. **Given** I compare different types (e.g., "5" == 5), **When** using == operator, **Then** I get False and understand type matters for equality

---

### User Story 3 - Combine Conditions with Logic (Priority: P3)

**As a beginner Python learner**, I want to **understand and use logical operators (and, or, not)** so that **I can combine multiple conditions for complex decision-making**.

**Why this priority**: Logical operators build on comparisons to enable more sophisticated reasoning. They're essential for Chapter 17 (Control Flow) but are introduced here to keep cognitive load manageable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having students combine comparison results using and/or/not and predict outcomes, then verify with Python and ask AI about truth table behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have two boolean values, **When** I use the `and` operator, **Then** I get True only if both are True
2. **Given** I have two boolean values, **When** I use the `or` operator, **Then** I get True if at least one is True
3. **Given** I have a boolean value, **When** I use the `not` operator, **Then** I get the opposite value
4. **Given** I combine comparisons (e.g., `x > 5 and x < 10`), **When** evaluating the expression, **Then** I understand it checks both conditions
5. **Given** I have nested logical operations (e.g., `not (x > 5 or y < 3)`), **When** evaluating, **Then** I can work with AI to understand evaluation order

---

### User Story 4 - Update Variables Efficiently (Priority: P4)

**As a beginner Python learner**, I want to **understand and use assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)** so that **I can update variable values concisely without repetition**.

**Why this priority**: Assignment operators make code more readable and efficient. They're commonly used in loops (Ch 17) and are easier to learn now while students are focused on operators, rather than mixing with loop syntax later.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having students start with a variable, apply shorthand operators, and verify results match the expanded form (e.g., x += 5 is the same as x = x + 5).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a variable `x = 10`, **When** I use `x += 5`, **Then** x becomes 15 and I understand it's equivalent to `x = x + 5`
2. **Given** I have a variable, **When** I use `-=`, `*=`, `/=` operators, **Then** I understand they're shorthand for the corresponding arithmetic operation
3. **Given** I need to increment a counter, **When** I use `count += 1`, **Then** I recognize this is more concise than `count = count + 1`
4. **Given** I update a variable with shorthand, **When** I ask AI to show the expanded form, **Then** I verify they produce identical results

---

### User Story 5 - Recognize Reserved Words (Priority: P5)

**As a beginner Python learner**, I want to **understand what Python keywords are and why I can't use them as variable names** so that **I avoid syntax errors and understand Python's reserved words**.

**Why this priority**: Keywords are foundational knowledge that prevents common errors. This is "learn once, apply forever" content - best taught early before students develop bad habits.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by showing students the keyword list, having them attempt to use a keyword as a variable name (seeing the error), and asking AI to explain why keywords are reserved.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I see the Python keyword list (import keyword; print(keyword.kwlist)), **When** reviewing the list, **Then** I recognize common words like `if`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `class`
2. **Given** I try to create a variable named `for`, **When** running the code, **Then** I get a SyntaxError and understand why
3. **Given** I need to name a variable related to a keyword, **When** choosing a name, **Then** I use alternatives like `for_loop` or `user_class` instead of reserved words
4. **Given** I'm unsure if a word is a keyword, **When** I ask AI or check keyword.kwlist, **Then** I can verify before using it

---

### Edge Cases

- **Division by zero**: What happens when a student uses `/` or `//` with 0 as divisor? (ZeroDivisionError - students should ask AI to explain)
- **Type mixing in operations**: What happens when adding int + str (e.g., 5 + "hello")? (TypeError - opportunity to discuss type safety)
- **Float precision**: What happens with 0.1 + 0.2? (Result is 0.30000000000000004 - students ask AI why floating point arithmetic has precision issues)
- **Boolean operators with non-boolean values**: What happens with `5 and 10` or `0 or "hello"`? (Truthiness concept - deferred to Ch 17, but AI can explain if students ask)
- **Operator precedence**: What happens with `2 + 3 * 4`? (Result is 14, not 20 - students should ask AI about order of operations)
- **Keyword case sensitivity**: What happens with `For` or `IF` instead of `for`/`if`? (Not keywords - Python is case-sensitive, but still bad practice)

---

## Out of Scope

**Content Explicitly Excluded from Chapter 15:**

- Identity operators (is, is not) and memory concepts (id()) - requires understanding of object references (Chapter 24+)
- Membership operators (in, not in) - requires collection types (Chapter 18-19)
- Bitwise operators (~, &, |, ^, <<, >>) - requires binary number system understanding (advanced topic)
- Walrus operator (:=) - advanced syntax for inline assignment

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: Students confuse comparison operators with assignment**
- **Impact**: High - leads to bugs like `if x = 5:` instead of `if x == 5:`
- **Probability**: High - extremely common beginner mistake
- **Mitigation**: Explicitly contrast `=` (assignment) vs `==` (comparison) with side-by-side examples. Use clear error message when mistake is made. Include in "Try With AI" prompts.

**Risk 2: Division by zero not understood as error condition**
- **Impact**: Medium - students see ZeroDivisionError and panic, think they "broke" Python
- **Probability**: Medium - will occur when experimenting
- **Mitigation**: Demonstrate division by zero intentionally in lesson, normalize errors as learning opportunities. "Try With AI" prompt: "I got ZeroDivisionError. What does this mean and when might it happen in real programs?"

**Risk 3: Float precision surprises students**
- **Impact**: Medium - confusion when `0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3` exactly
- **Probability**: High - will occur during exploration
- **Mitigation**: Include in edge cases. "Try With AI" prompt: "Why does 0.1 + 0.2 give 0.30000000000000004?" Explain floating point limitation, defer deep dive to later chapters.

**Risk 4: Operator precedence confusion**
- **Impact**: Medium - wrong calculation results (e.g., `2 + 3 * 4` misunderstood)
- **Probability**: Medium - students from math backgrounds may handle well, others struggle
- **Mitigation**: Mention PEMDAS/BODMAS in arithmetic lesson. Encourage parentheses for clarity. "Try With AI" prompt: "Ask AI to explain order of operations and when to use parentheses."

**Risk 5: Too many operators overwhelms beginners**
- **Impact**: High - cognitive overload leads to drop-off
- **Probability**: Medium - 4 operator categories + keywords = potentially too much
- **Mitigation**: Strict 5-concept-per-lesson limit enforced. Spread operators across 4 separate lessons. Capstone reinforces without introducing new concepts. Skills proficiency mapping validates cognitive load.

**Risk 6: Students skip "Try With AI" exercises**
- **Impact**: High - miss core AI-Native Learning practice, fall back to memorization
- **Probability**: Medium - exercises optional, students may skip if pressed for time
- **Mitigation**: Make "Try With AI" visually distinct and explicitly state "This is not optional - AI partnership is how professionals learn." Track completion in platform analytics (SC-006).

**Risk 7: Type hint confusion from Chapter 14 not resolved**
- **Impact**: High - students copy type hints without understanding, creating bugs
- **Probability**: Medium - type hints are advanced for beginners
- **Mitigation**: Chapter 14 prerequisite validation. Quick review in Chapter 15 Lesson 1. Use type() in operator examples to verify result types. "Try With AI" prompt: "Why does this expression return float even though both operands are int?"

## Notes

**Design Philosophy:**

This chapter represents a critical transition point: students move from **knowing data types exist** (Chapter 14) to **doing things with data** (Chapter 15). Operators are the verbs in Python's language - they make data active and useful.

The 4-operator-category structure follows a natural progression:
1. **Arithmetic** - most familiar (everyone knows 2 + 2)
2. **Comparison** - introduces True/False results (prepare for Chapter 17's if statements)
3. **Logical** - combines boolean values (AND/OR/NOT logic needed for complex conditions)
4. **Assignment** - efficiency upgrade (shorthand builds on arithmetic)

Keywords are included as the 5th concept because:
- They're orthogonal to operators (different concern)
- They're "learn once, remember forever" content
- Preventing keyword misuse now saves debugging time later
- Fits cognitive load limit (5 concepts total)

**AI-Native Learning Application:**

Operators are PERFECT for AI partnership because:
- **Exploratory learning**: "What happens if I divide int by int?" → AI explains why result is float
- **Edge case discovery**: "What happens with 0.1 + 0.2?" → AI explains floating point precision
- **Validation practice**: "Is this result correct?" → AI confirms or corrects, building verification habits
- **Conceptual deepening**: "Why does Python have both / and //?" → AI explains use cases for each

The "Try With AI" prompts in this chapter are designed to build confidence in using AI as a co-reasoning partner, not just a code generator. Students learn to ASK GOOD QUESTIONS - a meta-skill more valuable than memorizing operator tables.

**Ruthless Filtering Rationale:**

Many traditional Python tutorials teach 6-8 operator categories (arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, identity, membership, bitwise, special). This creates cognitive overload and most categories aren't used by beginners.

By filtering to 4 core categories + keywords, we:
- Respect A1-A2 cognitive load limits (5 concepts max)
- Teach what students will actually use in Chapters 16-20
- Defer advanced operators (is, in, bitwise) until students have the prerequisite knowledge (memory models, collections, binary math)
- Enable depth over breadth (students truly understand 4 categories rather than memorizing 8 superficially)

Identity operators (is, is not) are ESPECIALLY important to exclude because:
- They require understanding object identity vs. equality (Chapter 24+ OOP concept)
- They confuse beginners who think "is" is "equals" (it's not - it's memory location comparison)
- They're rarely needed in beginner code (== is almost always correct)
- Teaching them now would require explaining memory addresses and references - completely out of scope

**Validation Strategy:**

Every lesson includes type() usage to verify result types. This serves multiple purposes:
1. Reinforces Chapter 14's type hint learning
2. Builds validation-first thinking (never assume, always verify)
3. Reveals surprising behaviors (int / int → float, not int // int)
4. Demonstrates Python introspection capabilities
5. Prepares for isinstance() in later chapters

Students should develop the reflex: "Write code → Run it → Check type → Ask AI if surprised"

This validation-first mindset is professional development practice and core to AI-Native Learning.
