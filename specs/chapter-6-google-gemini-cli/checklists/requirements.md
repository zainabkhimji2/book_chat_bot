# Specification Quality Checklist: Comprehensive Gemini CLI Chapter Enhancement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Spec focuses on WHAT users learn and WHY, not HOW to implement technically
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - All user stories frame features in terms of north star business developer productivity
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Language is business-focused, avoids jargon where possible, explains technical concepts clearly
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Out of Scope, Dependencies all present and detailed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All requirements are specific and actionable
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Each FR has clear, measurable criteria (e.g., "Chapter MUST explain X" with specific content)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - All SC items include specific metrics (percentages, time savings, capability counts)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - SC focuses on learning outcomes and productivity, not implementation details
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - 6 user stories each have 5-8 detailed Given/When/Then scenarios
- [x] Edge cases are identified - 8 specific edge cases documented with expected behaviors
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Out of Scope section explicitly excludes 12+ topics (custom MCP development, source code deep dive, production deployment, etc.)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Prerequisites from earlier chapters, external dependencies, and technical assumptions documented

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - 35 FRs each map to specific chapter content sections
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - 6 prioritized user stories (P1-P3) cover command mastery, configuration, memory, MCP, custom commands, extensions
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - 15 SC items cover skill acquisition, productivity improvement, tool mastery, workflow integration, and content quality
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Spec describes educational outcomes and chapter content structure, not lesson implementation methods

## Validation Notes

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Specification addresses the user's concern that current chapter is "too thin" by defining 35 functional requirements covering all major Gemini CLI capabilities
2. **Prioritized User Stories**: 6 stories with P1-P3 priorities create clear learning progression from core commands → configuration → memory → MCP → custom commands → extensions
3. **Measurable Success**: 15 success criteria with specific percentages and metrics enable validation of chapter effectiveness
4. **Clear Scope Boundaries**: Out of Scope section explicitly excludes 12+ advanced topics to prevent scope creep
5. **Business Developer Focus**: All scenarios framed in terms of "north star business developer" productivity and real-world workflows

### Areas of Excellence
- **Edge Cases**: 8 specific edge cases identified with expected behaviors (file not found, conflicting settings, MCP crashes, context overflow)
- **Realistic Scenarios**: All acceptance scenarios use concrete business examples (competitor research, API documentation, team workflows)
- **Security Integration**: Security considerations woven throughout (tool restrictions, extension evaluation, trust boundaries)
- **Platform Coverage**: Notes emphasize cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ **SPECIFICATION APPROVED FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. The specification is:
- Complete (all mandatory sections filled with specific, actionable content)
- Testable (35 FRs with clear criteria, 15 measurable SCs)
- Scoped (clear boundaries, dependencies, and exclusions)
- Aligned with user needs (addresses "too thin" concern with comprehensive coverage)

**Readiness for Next Phase**: This specification is ready for `/sp.plan` to create lesson-by-lesson breakdown and `/sp.tasks` to generate implementation checklist.

## Recommendations for Planning Phase

When moving to `/sp.plan`, consider:

1. **Lesson Structure**: Break into 5-6 lessons following the user story progression:
   - Lesson 1: Core Commands & Workflow (P1)
   - Lesson 2: Configuration System (P2)
   - Lesson 3: Context & Memory Management (P2)
   - Lesson 4: MCP Servers for Business Intelligence (P3)
   - Lesson 5: Custom Slash Commands (P3)
   - Lesson 6: Extensions Ecosystem (P3)

2. **Hands-On Exercises**: Each lesson should include 3-5 realistic business scenarios that readers execute with Gemini CLI

3. **Progressive Complexity**: Ensure lessons build on each other (can't use MCP without understanding commands and configuration)

4. **Cross-Platform Testing**: All code examples and commands must be tested on Windows, macOS, and Linux

5. **Security Emphasis**: Include security evaluation sections in lessons covering MCP servers and extensions

6. **Visual Aids**: Consider diagrams for:
   - Configuration hierarchy (7 levels)
   - Memory types (ephemeral, GEMINI.md, save_memory)
   - MCP architecture (CLI → MCP server → external system)
   - Extension structure (manifest, servers, commands, context)

7. **Decision Framework**: Final lesson should include decision tree or flowchart for "when to use Gemini CLI vs. Claude Code"

**Next Command**: `/sp.plan` to transform this approved spec into detailed lesson plan
