# Implementation Tasks: Comprehensive Gemini CLI Chapter Enhancement

**Feature**: Chapter 6 - Google Gemini CLI
**Branch**: `feature/chapter-6-google-gemini-cli`
**Created**: 2025-11-07
**Specification**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Plan**: [plan.md](./plan.md)

## Executive Summary

### Strategy Decision: Update vs. Create

After careful analysis of existing lessons, we will **UPDATE all 5 existing lessons** rather than create new ones. This approach:
- Preserves existing quality content (why it matters, installation basics, tool overview)
- Extends each lesson with missing core functionality
- Maintains lesson flow and numbering
- Focuses enhancement effort where gaps exist

**No new lessons will be created.** All 35 functional requirements will be addressed through strategic updates to the 5 existing files.

### LESSON 4: Memory Management Systems (04-context-window-and-tool-comparison.md)

**Status**: 🔄 **Complete Redesign Required**
**Current Title**: "Choosing the Right AI Tool: When Size Matters"
**New Title**: "Memory Management: Teaching Gemini Your Project Context"

**Current State**: Lesson focuses on context window comparison (~310 lines)
**Current Sections** (REMOVE MOST):
- What is a context window (reading capacity analogy) - **REMOVE** (covered in Lesson 1)
- Simple comparison table (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) - **REMOVE** (covered in Lesson 1)
- When context size doesn't matter (80% of work) - **KEEP** (rename to "When Memory Matters")
- When context size matters (large codebases, multi-file analysis) - **TRANSFORM** to "When to Use Each Memory Type"

**Strategy**: This lesson will be **completely redesigned** to focus on Gemini CLI's 3 memory systems, not context window comparison. Context window comparison remains in Lesson 1.

**What to REMOVE** (~200 lines):
- Detailed context window explanations (move to Lesson 1 if not there)
- ChatGPT/Claude comparisons (redundant with Lesson 1)
- Generic "which tool to use" content (Lesson 1 covers this)

**What to ADD**: 4 major new sections (~540 lines total, replacing removed content = ~340 net new)

---

#### Task 4.1: Add Three Memory Types Overview (MUST) ⭐⭐⭐

**Priority**: P2
**Effort**: 6 hours
**FRs Covered**: FR-011 (three memory types)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] **Rename file**: Consider renaming to `04-memory-management-systems.md` (or keep filename, change title in frontmatter)
- [ ] Add new introduction: "## Your AI's Three Brains: How Gemini Remembers"
- [ ] Explain memory philosophy: "Professional developers don't re-explain their project structure every session. Gemini CLI has 3 memory systems to learn your context once."
- [ ] Document 3 memory types with clear distinctions:

**1. Ephemeral Context (Session Memory)**
- **What**: Current conversation only
- **Lifetime**: Lost when session ends
- **Use Case**: Active discussion, current task focus
- **Example**: "Analyzing these 5 files right now"
- **Capacity**: 1M tokens

**2. GEMINI.md Files (Hierarchical Project Memory)**
- **What**: Persistent project instructions loaded automatically
- **Lifetime**: Permanent (file-based)
- **Use Case**: Project standards, coding conventions, architecture notes
- **Example**: "Always use TypeScript strict mode in this project"
- **Capacity**: Unlimited (limited by context window when loaded)
- **Hierarchy**: Global → Project → Subdirectory (covered in Task 4.2)

**3. save_memory (Long-Term Facts)**
- **What**: Discrete facts Gemini stores globally
- **Lifetime**: Permanent (stored in global GEMINI.md)
- **Use Case**: Personal preferences, API key locations, common patterns
- **Example**: "My API keys are always in .env.local, never .env"
- **Capacity**: Unlimited facts (kept concise)

- [ ] Create comparison table:
  | Memory Type | Persistence | Scope | Best For |
  |-------------|-------------|-------|----------|
  | Ephemeral | Session only | Current conversation | Active work |
  | GEMINI.md | Permanent | Project or global | Standards, architecture |
  | save_memory | Permanent | Global (all projects) | Personal facts |

- [ ] Business scenario: "Project GEMINI.md has React coding standards. Your personal save_memory knows you prefer functional components. Both apply when you work on this React project."

**Success Criteria**: 80% can explain when to use each memory type (SC-003 from spec)

---

#### Task 4.2: Add GEMINI.md Hierarchical System (MUST) ⭐⭐⭐

**Priority**: P2
**Effort**: 10 hours
**FRs Covered**: FR-012 (hierarchical loading), FR-013 (/memory commands), FR-015 (@file.md syntax)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Add new section: "## GEMINI.md Files: Your Project's Persistent Intelligence"
- [ ] Explain concept: "GEMINI.md is a markdown file that Gemini reads automatically at startup. Think of it as your project's README for AI."
- [ ] Document 3-level hierarchy with loading order:
  1. **Global** (`~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`): Personal preferences, global standards
  2. **Project** (`/project-root/.gemini/GEMINI.md`): Project-specific context
  3. **Subdirectory** (`/project-root/src/api/.gemini/GEMINI.md`): Component-specific notes
- [ ] Explain loading behavior:
  - All 3 levels load and combine hierarchically
  - More specific files (subdirectory) override general files (global)
  - View combined result with `/memory show`
- [ ] Provide 3 complete GEMINI.md templates:

**Template 1: Global GEMINI.md** (`~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`):
```markdown
# Global Development Preferences

## Coding Style
- Always use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use async/await over promises

## Security Rules
- API keys MUST be in .env.local, never .env
- Never commit .env files to git
- Always validate user input

## Project Structure Patterns I Use
- `src/` for source code
- `tests/` for test files
- `docs/` for documentation
```

**Template 2: Project GEMINI.md** (`/project/.gemini/GEMINI.md`):
```markdown
# E-Commerce Platform Project Context

## Technology Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Node.js backend with Express
- PostgreSQL database
- Stripe for payments

## Business Domain
- B2B e-commerce for office supplies
- Target: Small businesses (10-100 employees)
- Key features: Bulk ordering, invoicing, account management

## Architecture
- Monorepo with 3 packages: web, api, shared
- API follows RESTful conventions
- Database uses row-level security

## Team Coding Standards
- Use React hooks, no class components
- All API routes require authentication
- Database queries must use parameterized statements
```

**Template 3: Subdirectory GEMINI.md** (`/project/src/api/.gemini/GEMINI.md`):
```markdown
# API Package Context

## This Package
- RESTful API endpoints
- Authentication: JWT tokens
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/min per user

## Key Files
- `routes/` - Express route definitions
- `middleware/` - Auth, validation, error handling
- `controllers/` - Business logic
- `models/` - Database schemas (Prisma)

## Development Guidelines
- All endpoints must have OpenAPI docs
- All mutations must have audit logging
- All responses must match TypeScript types in `shared/types`
```

- [ ] Explain `@file.md` syntax for modularization:
  ```markdown
  # Main GEMINI.md

  @security-rules.md
  @coding-standards.md
  @architecture.md
  ```
  - Gemini loads referenced files inline
  - Keeps main file concise
  - Share modules across projects

- [ ] Add 3 hands-on exercises:
  1. Create global `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` with 3 personal preferences
  2. Create project `.gemini/GEMINI.md` with technology stack and standards
  3. Use `/memory show` to verify both files loaded

**Success Criteria**: 80% can create hierarchical GEMINI.md setup (SC-003 from spec)

- [ ] Document 3 essential commands:

**1. `/memory show`** - View Combined Context
- Shows all loaded GEMINI.md files hierarchically combined
- Use when: "What context does Gemini have about my project?"
- Output: Complete GEMINI.md content (global + project + subdirectory)

**2. `/memory add <text>`** - Quick Fact Addition
- Appends text to global GEMINI.md under "## Gemini Added Memories"
- Use when: "Remember this important fact"
- Example: `/memory add Always use snake_case for database column names`

**3. `/memory reload`** - Refresh Context
- Reloads all GEMINI.md files without restarting CLI
- Use when: You edited GEMINI.md files and want changes active immediately
- Faster than restarting Gemini CLI

- [ ] Add workflow example:
  1. Create project GEMINI.md with coding standards
  2. Start Gemini CLI (auto-loads GEMINI.md)
  3. Ask coding question → Gemini applies standards from GEMINI.md
  4. Edit GEMINI.md to add new standard
  5. Run `/memory reload` to apply changes
  6. Ask another coding question → Gemini applies new standard

- [ ] Business scenario: "Mid-project, team decides on new naming convention. Update GEMINI.md, run `/memory reload`, continue working with new standard."

- [ ] Add 1 hands-on exercise: Create GEMINI.md, use `/memory show`, edit file, use `/memory reload`, verify with `/memory show`

**Success Criteria**: 75% can use /memory commands to manage context

#### Task 4.4: Add save_memory Tool Usage (MUST) ⭐⭐

**Priority**: P2
**Effort**: 4 hours
**FRs Covered**: FR-014 (save_memory vs GEMINI.md)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Add new section: "## save_memory: Your AI's Long-Term Knowledge Base"
- [ ] Explain when save_memory is used:
  - Gemini invokes save_memory automatically when you say "remember that..."
  - User cannot invoke save_memory directly (it's a tool Gemini uses)
  - Facts stored globally in `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` under "## Gemini Added Memories"
- [ ] Differentiate from manual GEMINI.md:
  - **save_memory**: Quick facts, Gemini manages, conversational
  - **Manual GEMINI.md**: Structured documentation, you manage, organized by project
- [ ] Document save_memory workflow:
  1. You: "Remember that I always use Prettier for code formatting"
  2. Gemini uses save_memory internally
  3. Fact appended to `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`
  4. Future sessions: Gemini auto-applies Prettier preference
- [ ] Show example `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` after several save_memory operations:
  ```markdown
  ## Gemini Added Memories

  - I always use Prettier for code formatting
  - My API keys are stored in .env.local, never .env
  - I prefer functional programming with React hooks
  - My test files use Jest with React Testing Library
  - I organize imports: external libs, then internal modules
  ```
- [ ] When to use each:
  - **save_memory**: Spontaneous facts during conversation ("Oh, remember API keys go in .env.local")
  - **GEMINI.md**: Planned, structured project documentation (architecture, standards, domain knowledge)
- [ ] Add 2 hands-on exercises:
  1. Tell Gemini 3 facts to remember (coding style, file locations, preferences)
  2. Restart Gemini CLI, verify it remembers by asking questions that require those facts

**Success Criteria**: 80% understand save_memory vs GEMINI.md tradeoffs

---

#### Task 4.5: Update "Try With AI" Section (MUST) ⭐

**Priority**: P2
**Effort**: 2 hours
**FRs Covered**: Multiple (hands-on memory practice)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Replace all existing "Try With AI" prompts with 4 memory-focused exercises:
  1. **Memory Type Selection**: "I have 3 scenarios. Tell me which memory type to use: (1) Current analysis of competitor pricing (2) Our team's React component naming conventions (3) My personal preference for error handling patterns"
  2. **GEMINI.md Setup**: "Help me create a complete project GEMINI.md for a Django e-commerce API. Include: tech stack, architecture (REST API with PostgreSQL), coding standards (PEP 8, type hints), and business domain (B2C fashion retail)"
  3. **Hierarchical Memory**: "I have a monorepo with 3 packages: web, api, database. Design a GEMINI.md hierarchy: global file with my personal preferences, project root with monorepo architecture, and package-specific files for each package"
  4. **Memory Commands Workflow**: "Walk me through: (1) Creating a GEMINI.md with 3 coding standards (2) Using /memory show to verify it loaded (3) Adding a 4th standard via /memory add (4) Using /memory show again to confirm"
- [ ] Add success indicator: "You've mastered memory when Gemini knows your project context without you explaining it every session"

**Success Criteria**: 70% complete all 4 memory exercises successfully

**Workflow 4: GitHub Repository Analysis** (GitHub MCP):
```
Your goal: Understand competitor's open-source architecture by analyzing their GitHub repo

Prompt:
"Use the GitHub MCP server to:
1. Search for [competitor-name] repositories related to [domain]
2. Read the README from their main repository
3. List the 10 most recent pull requests
4. Analyze file structure (what directories exist)
5. Summarize their architecture based on code organization"

What Gemini does:
1. Searches GitHub for matching repositories
2. Retrieves README content
3. Fetches PR data via GitHub API
4. Analyzes directory structure
5. Provides architecture summary with links to specific files

Business value: Understand competitor tech stack without manual repo exploration (saves 1-2 hours)
```

**Workflow 5: Multi-Source Research** (Playwright + Context7):

"I'm adding Stripe payments to my e-commerce site. Use:
- Context7 to get latest Stripe API documentation
- Playwright to browse 3 competitor payment flows:
  - competitor-a.com/checkout
  - competitor-b.com/payment
  - competitor-c.com/buy

Create a comparison: what payment methods do competitors support, how does Stripe documentation recommend implementing each, and what's the recommended approach for my use case?"

What Gemini does:
1. Queries Context7 for current Stripe payment method docs
2. Launches Playwright to browse 3 competitor sites
3. Extracts payment method support from each
4. Synthesizes: official docs + competitor analysis + recommendation

Business value: Comprehensive research in 10 minutes vs. 2-3 hours manually
```

**Workflow 6: Live Documentation Debugging** (Context7):
```
Your goal: Understand breaking changes in framework update

Prompt:
"Our app uses Next.js 13. Next.js 14 was just released. Use Context7 to:
1. Fetch Next.js 14 migration guide
2. Identify breaking changes that affect App Router
3. Explain what code changes we need to make
4. Provide example before/after code for each breaking change"

What Gemini does:
1. Queries Context7 for Next.js 14 documentation
2. Identifies breaking changes section
3. Extracts App Router changes specifically
4. Generates migration examples

Business value: Immediate understanding of upgrade requirements (save 30-60 min research)
```

- [ ] Add hands-on exercise for each workflow (3 total)

#### Task 5.3: Add Custom Slash Commands Creation (MUST) ⭐⭐⭐

**Priority**: P3
**Effort**: 8 hours
**FRs Covered**: FR-021 (TOML structure), FR-022 (naming), FR-023 (user vs project scope), FR-024 ({{args}}), FR-025 (!{command})

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Add new section: "## Custom Slash Commands: Automate Your Workflows"
- [ ] Explain concept: "Turn repeated multi-step prompts into single commands"
- [ ] Document TOML file structure with complete example:

**Basic Custom Command** (`~/.gemini/commands/research.toml`):
```toml
description = "Research a competitor and create analysis report"
prompt = """
Research {{args}} (competitor name) and provide:

1. Company overview (founding, size, funding)
2. Product offerings (main products/services)
3. Technology stack (if public/observable)
4. Pricing model
5. Target market
6. Recent news (last 3 months)

Create a structured markdown report with citations.
"""
```
- Invocation: `/research Shopify`
- `{{args}}` is replaced with "Shopify"

**Command with Shell Execution** (`~/.gemini/commands/git/review.toml`):
```toml
description = "Review recent git changes and suggest improvements"
prompt = """
First, get the recent commit log:
!{git log --oneline -10}

Then, show what changed in the last commit:
!{git diff HEAD~1}

Based on this context:
1. Summarize what changed
2. Identify any code quality issues
3. Suggest improvements
4. Check if commit messages are clear

Provide actionable feedback.
"""
```
- Invocation: `/git:review`
- `!{command}` executes shell commands, output included in prompt

**Command with Multiple Arguments** (`~/.gemini/commands/compare.toml`):
```toml
description = "Compare two files or technologies"
prompt = """
Compare {{args}} (provide two items separated by 'vs')

Analyze:
1. Key differences
2. Strengths and weaknesses
3. Use cases for each
4. Recommendation based on context

Format as comparison table.
"""
```
- Invocation: `/compare React vs Vue`
- `{{args}}` receives "React vs Vue"

- [ ] Document naming and scoping:
  - **User-scoped**: `~/.gemini/commands/cmd.toml` → `/cmd` (all projects)
  - **Project-scoped**: `.gemini/commands/cmd.toml` → `/cmd` (this project only)
  - **Namespaced**: `commands/git/commit.toml` → `/git:commit` (avoid name conflicts)
- [ ] Explain precedence: Project commands override user commands with same name
- [ ] Business scenarios:
  - **Team workflow**: Share `.gemini/commands/` in git for consistent team commands
  - **Personal automation**: User commands for your repetitive tasks
- [ ] Add 3 hands-on exercises:
  1. Create `/analyze` command that analyzes a file or directory structure
  2. Create `/test-plan` command that generates test cases from requirements
  3. Create namespaced `/docs:generate` command with shell execution

**Success Criteria**: 70% can create custom commands (SC-008 from spec)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Add new section: "## Extensions: Pre-Packaged Capabilities"
- [ ] Differentiate from MCP servers:
  - **MCP Server**: Individual tool (Playwright, Context7, GitHub)
  - **Extension**: Bundle of MCP servers + custom commands + GEMINI.md context + settings
- [ ] Explain extension structure (`gemini-extension.json`):
  ```json
  {
    "name": "business-intelligence",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Competitive research and market analysis toolkit",
    "mcpServers": {
      "playwright": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
      },
      "context7": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
      }
    },
    "commands": ["research.toml", "compare.toml"],
    "contextFileName": "BI_CONTEXT.md",
    "excludeTools": []
  }
  ```
- [ ] Document installation methods:
  1. **From GitHub**: `gemini extensions install github:username/extension-name`
  2. **From URL**: `gemini extensions install https://github.com/user/repo`
  3. **From local directory**: `gemini extensions link /path/to/extension` (development)
- [ ] Add security evaluation framework:
  **Before installing extension, ask these 4 questions:**
  1. **Who created it?**
     - Official Gemini team? ✅ High trust
     - Reputable company? ⚠️ Verify reputation
     - Individual developer? ⚠️ Check GitHub activity, stars, issues
  2. **What does it include?**
     - View `gemini-extension.json` on GitHub
     - Check which MCP servers it installs
     - Review custom commands it adds
     - Read GEMINI.md context it loads
  3. **What data access does it need?**
     - Read-only tools? ✅ Lower risk
     - Write access to files? ⚠️ Moderate risk
     - Shell command execution? ⚠️ Higher risk
     - API keys required? ⚠️ Verify security practices
  4. **Is it maintained?**
     - Recent commits (last 3 months)? ✅ Active
     - Open issues addressed? ✅ Responsive
     - No activity for 6+ months? ⚠️ Potentially abandoned
- [ ] Add decision framework:
  - **Install extension if**: Bundles 3+ tools you need, from trusted source, actively maintained
  - **Install individual MCP servers if**: You only need 1-2 specific tools, want full control
- [ ] Business scenario: "Business Intelligence extension bundles Playwright + Context7 + custom `/research` and `/compare` commands. Install once, get complete competitive analysis toolkit."
- [ ] Add 2 hands-on exercises:
  1. Research available Gemini CLI extensions on GitHub (ask Gemini to search)
  2. Evaluate one extension using the 4-question security framework

**Success Criteria**: 80% can evaluate extension security (SC-009 from spec)

- [ ] Reference official MCP server development guide:
  - Link: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/building-servers
  - Mention: "Building MCP servers requires TypeScript/Python knowledge (advanced topic)"
- [ ] Document security best practices:
  1. **Principle of least privilege**: Only grant MCP servers permissions they need
  2. **Tool filtering**: Use `allowed` and `excluded` to restrict operations
  3. **Environment variable isolation**: Use `.env` for secrets, not hardcoded in settings.json
  4. **Review before auto-approval**: Don't add MCP server tools to `tools.allowed` until you trust them
- [ ] Add hands-on exercise: Configure GitHub MCP with read-only restrictions (no create/push)

**Success Criteria**: 60% understand when to build custom MCP servers vs. use existing ones

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Content Overwhelm
**Risk**: Adding 2,060 lines might overwhelm readers
**Mitigation**:
- Core content remains ~100 min (within 60-90 min target with flexibility)
- Advanced sections (custom commands, extensions) marked as optional
- Progressive disclosure: basics → intermediate → advanced
- Hands-on exercises break up reading

### Risk 2: Platform Compatibility
**Risk**: Examples fail on specific OS (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Mitigation**:
- Task 7.1: Explicit cross-platform testing requirement
- All file paths use platform-agnostic examples
- PowerShell vs Command Prompt differences noted for Windows
- Shell syntax compatible with bash/zsh (macOS/Linux) and PowerShell (Windows)

### Risk 3: Rapid Gemini CLI Evolution
**Risk**: New versions break examples
**Mitigation**:
- Pin examples to specific version (0.4.0+) in prerequisites
- Add note: "Examples current as of January 2025, verify with latest docs"
- Link to official documentation for exhaustive reference
- Focus on stable features (slash commands, configuration, MCP protocol)

### Risk 4: MCP Server Availability
**Risk**: Recommended MCP servers (Playwright, Context7, GitHub) become unavailable
**Mitigation**:
- Choose widely-adopted servers with strong backing
- Explain MCP server discovery process (teach fishing, not give fish)
- Include alternative server suggestions
- Emphasize building custom servers for critical dependencies
