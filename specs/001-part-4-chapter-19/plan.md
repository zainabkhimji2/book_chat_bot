**Estimated Total Time**: 4.5–5 hours (6 lessons × 45–50 min each)
**Part**: Part 4 - Python Fundamentals
**Complexity Tier**: A2-B1 (Intermediate Beginners)
**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Feature Branch**: `019-set-frozenset-gc`

## 🎯 Chapter Overview & Context

**Building on Chapter 18 Foundation**:
- Chapter 18 taught: Lists, tuples, dictionaries — ordered/unordered, mutable/immutable collections
- Chapter 19 builds on this by teaching: Sets (unordered, unique), frozensets (hashable), garbage collection (memory management)

**Bridge to Chapter 20**:
- Chapter 19 completes Python's core collection types (list, tuple, dict, set, frozenset)
- Chapter 20 (Modules and Functions) builds on collection understanding — students will pass collections to functions

**Prerequisites Established**:
- Chapter 13: Python basics (variables, `print()`)
- Chapter 14: Data types and type hints
- Chapter 15: Operators (arithmetic, comparison)
- Chapter 16: Strings and type casting
- Chapter 17: Control flow (loops enable set operations)
- Chapter 18: Lists, tuples, dicts (collection concepts, mutability, iteration)

**AI-Native Learning Pattern** (how students learn sets with AI):
- **Describe intent**: Type hints describe set structure (`unique_ids: set[int]` says "set of integers, guaranteed unique")
- **Explore with AI**: Students ask "What can I do with a set?" instead of reading method documentation
- **Validate together**: Set operations and O(1) lookup enable practical comparisons with lists
- **Learn from errors**: TypeError on unhashable types leads to understanding immutability requirement

**Key Scope Boundaries** (Chapter 19 Responsibility):
- ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: Set creation, operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference), set comprehensions, frozensets, reference counting, garbage collection concepts
- ✅ **Awareness Only**: Hash function algorithms, CPython internals, advanced GC tuning
- ❌ **Deferred**: Custom hashing (requires Chapter 24 OOP), weakref (advanced), gc module deep-dive (Chapter 29 CPython/GIL)

numbers: set[int] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
colors: set[str] = {"red", "green", "blue"}
mixed: set[int | str] = {1, "two", 3}  # Python 3.10+ union syntax

# Set constructor syntax
from_list: set[int] = set([1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1])

```
- **Purpose**: Show set creation patterns, type hints, uniqueness in action
- **Complexity**: Beginner-Intermediate (syntax + property)
- **Pedagogical Value**: Establishes set syntax and automatic deduplication

**Code Example 2: Understanding Uniqueness**
```python
# Duplicates are automatically eliminated
email_list: list[str] = ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com", "alice@example.com"]
unique_emails: set[str] = set(email_list)

print(f"List length: {len(email_list)}")           # 3
print(f"Set length: {len(unique_emails)}")         # 2
print(f"Unique emails: {unique_emails}")           # {'alice@example.com', 'bob@example.com'}

# Practical use: Deduplication
user_ids: set[int] = {100, 101, 102, 101, 100}  # Duplicate IDs
print(f"Unique users: {user_ids}")                 # {100, 101, 102}
```
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate why uniqueness matters; practical use case
- **Complexity**: Beginner (familiar list concept applied to sets)
- **Pedagogical Value**: Shows concrete business value of sets

**Code Example 3: Modifying Sets**
```python
# Create and modify sets
visited_cities: set[str] = {"Paris", "Tokyo", "London"}

# Add elements
visited_cities.add("New York")
visited_cities.add("Paris")  # No change - already exists
print(f"After adding: {visited_cities}")  # {'Paris', 'Tokyo', 'London', 'New York'}

# Remove elements (raises error if not found)
visited_cities.remove("Paris")
print(f"After removing Paris: {visited_cities}")

# Discard elements (no error if not found)
visited_cities.discard("Berlin")  # No error, Berlin not in set
visited_cities.discard("Tokyo")
print(f"After discarding: {visited_cities}")
```
- **Purpose**: Show mutation methods; distinguish `.remove()` vs `.discard()`
- **Complexity**: Beginner (method calls, error handling concept)
- **Pedagogical Value**: Practical set modification

**Code Example 4: The Hashability Requirement**
```python
# ✅ Hashable types work in sets
numbers: set[int] = {1, 2, 3}
strings: set[str] = {"a", "b"}
tuples: set[tuple[int, int]] = {(1, 2), (3, 4)}
frozen: set[frozenset[int]] = {frozenset([1, 2]), frozenset([3, 4])}

# ❌ Unhashable types fail
try:
    my_set: set[list[int]] = {[1, 2], [3, 4]}
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # unhashable type: 'list'

try:
    my_dict_set: set[dict[str, int]] = {{"a": 1}}
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # unhashable type: 'dict'

# Why? Lists and dicts are mutable - hash values would change!
```
- **Purpose**: Show hashability constraint; teach type validation
- **Complexity**: Intermediate (error handling, explaining why)
- **Pedagogical Value**: Prevents confusion when students try unhashable types

**Practice Approach**:
- **Exercise 1**: Create a set of usernames, add 5 names with type hints, attempt to add duplicate (see uniqueness)

charlie_interests: set[str] = {"hiking", "cooking", "yoga"}

# Common interests between two users
print(f"Alice & Bob share: {alice_interests & bob_interests}")  # {'cooking', 'reading'}
print(f"Alice & Charlie share: {alice_interests & charlie_interests}")  # {'hiking', 'cooking'}

# All three share these interests
all_share: set[str] = alice_interests & bob_interests & charlie_interests
print(f"All three share: {all_share}")  # {'cooking'}

# What does each person uniquely like?
alice_unique: set[str] = alice_interests - (bob_interests | charlie_interests)
print(f"Alice's unique interests: {alice_unique}")  # {'photography'}

# Interests unique to Alice that others don't have

4. Hash table structure (array indexed by hash values)
5. O(1) average-case lookup time
6. O(n) worst-case (rare, collision-heavy)
7. Rehashing when set grows

**Prerequisites**:
- Lesson 1: Set creation and understanding of hashability
- Chapter 15: Time complexity concepts (if covered) or brief introduction here

**Duration**: 50 minutes

**Content Outline**:
1. **Introduction** (5 min) - Why understanding internals matters; preview hash concept
2. **Concept: What Are Hash Functions?** (10 min) - Intuitive explanation, Python's `hash()` function, examples

```python
# Hash function converts objects to integers
print(f"hash(42): {hash(42)}")              # Some integer
print(f"hash('hello'): {hash('hello')}")    # Some integer
print(f"hash((1, 2)): {hash((1, 2))}")      # Some integer

# Same object = same hash (deterministic within session)
name: str = "Alice"
print(f"First hash: {hash(name)}")
print(f"Second hash: {hash(name)}")         # Same value

# Immutable requirement: mutable objects DON'T have hashes
try:
    print(f"hash([1, 2, 3]): {hash([1, 2, 3])}")
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # unhashable type: 'list'

try:
    print(f"hash({{'a': 1}}): {hash({'a': 1})}")
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # unhashable type: 'dict'

# Hashable immutable types
hashable_examples: set[tuple] = {(1, 2), (3, 4), ("x", "y")}
print(f"Hashable tuple set: {hashable_examples}")
```
- **Purpose**: Show hash function behavior; demonstrate hashability requirement
- **Complexity**: Intermediate (system-level understanding)
- **Pedagogical Value**: Builds intuition for "why immutable?"

**Code Example 2: Why Immutability is Required**
```python
# Illustration (pseudo-code explanation):
# If we COULD hash mutable objects:

# Original tuple: hash((1, 2)) = 12345
# If we modify:   (1, 2) -> (1, 3)
# New hash:       hash((1, 3)) = 54321
# But set still looks for original hash 12345!
# Result: Lookup fails, data appears "lost"

# This is why Python prevents it:
coords: tuple[int, int] = (1, 2)
print(f"Tuple is hashable: {hash(coords)}")  # Works

coords_list: list[int] = [1, 2]
try:
    print(f"List is hashable: {hash(coords_list)}")
except TypeError:
    print("Lists aren't hashable because they're mutable")

# Practical impact: what CAN and CAN'T be dict keys
valid_dict_1: dict[int, str] = {1: "a", 2: "b"}
valid_dict_2: dict[tuple[int, int], str] = {(1, 2): "position"}
valid_dict_3: dict[frozenset[int], str] = {frozenset([1, 2]): "group"}

try:
    invalid_dict: dict[list[int], str] = {[1, 2]: "position"}
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # unhashable type: 'list'
```
- **Purpose**: Explain why mutability breaks hashing; connect to dict keys
- **Complexity**: Intermediate (system thinking)
- **Pedagogical Value**: Prevents future confusion about "why can't I...?"

**Code Example 3: Performance Comparison — O(1) vs. O(n)**
```python
import time

# Create large list and set with same elements
elements: list[int] = list(range(1_000_000))
element_set: set[int] = set(elements)

# Lookup test: find if 999_999 is in collection
target: int = 999_999

# Set lookup (O(1) average)
start = time.perf_counter()
for _ in range(100_000):
    result_set = target in element_set
end = time.perf_counter()
set_time = end - start

# List lookup (O(n))
start = time.perf_counter()
for _ in range(100_000):
    result_list = target in elements
end = time.perf_counter()
list_time = end - start

print(f"Set lookup time: {set_time:.6f} seconds")   # Very fast
print(f"List lookup time: {list_time:.6f} seconds")  # Much slower
print(f"Set is {list_time / set_time:.0f}x faster")  # Often 1000x+ faster
```
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate real performance difference; make O(1) vs. O(n) concrete
- **Complexity**: Intermediate (performance analysis)
- **Pedagogical Value**: Why sets matter at scale

**Code Example 4: Hash Collisions (Conceptual)**
```python
# Hash collisions happen when different objects map to same hash value
# Python's hash table handles this internally (chaining or probing)

# Illustration (simplified):
# Imagine hash table with 10 slots (0-9)
# hash(1) % 10 = 1
# hash(11) % 10 = 1  <- collision! Both want slot 1
# Python stores both, retrieves by full value comparison as tiebreaker

# For learning purposes, we don't need to implement this
# But awareness helps understand O(1) is "average case"

# Rehashing happens automatically when set grows
my_set: set[int] = set()

# Python internally resizes the hash table
for i in range(1_000_000):
    my_set.add(i)

print(f"Set with 1M elements created successfully")  # Works seamlessly
print(f"Final set size: {len(my_set)}")              # 1,000,000
```
- **Purpose**: Explain collision handling and rehashing at high level
- **Complexity**: Intermediate (conceptual, not implementation)
- **Pedagogical Value**: Understand "O(1) average" qualification

**Code Example 5: Real-World Performance Decision**
```python
# Scenario: Check if user ID is in database

# BAD: Using a list (O(n) lookup)
def is_user_in_list(user_id: int, user_database: list[int]) -> bool:
    return user_id in user_database  # Slow for large databases

# GOOD: Using a set (O(1) lookup)
def is_user_in_set(user_id: int, user_database: set[int]) -> bool:
    return user_id in user_database  # Fast for large databases

# If you have 1M users and check 1000 times:
# List approach: ~1B comparisons
# Set approach: ~1000 comparisons (hash-based)

database_list: list[int] = list(range(1_000_000))
database_set: set[int] = set(range(1_000_000))

# Time a single check
import time
start = time.perf_counter()
_ = 999_999 in database_list
list_check = time.perf_counter() - start

start = time.perf_counter()
_ = 999_999 in database_set
set_check = time.perf_counter() - start

print(f"List check: {list_check*1000:.3f}ms")
print(f"Set check: {set_check*1000:.3f}ms")
print(f"Set is {list_check/set_check:.0f}x faster")
```
- **Purpose**: Apply O(1) concept to realistic scenario
- **Complexity**: Intermediate (decision-making)
- **Pedagogical Value**: When and why to use sets

**Practice Approach**:
- **Exercise 1**: Call `hash()` on different immutable objects, observe patterns
- **Exercise 2**: Verify that tuples are hashable but lists aren't
- **Exercise 3**: Time set vs. list lookup with 100K elements

        {1, 2}: "pair",
        {3, 4}: "another"
    }

    frozenset({"admin", "user"}): "Full access",
    frozenset({"user"}): "Read-only access",
    frozenset({"guest"}): "Public access"
}

print(f"Admin group access: {user_groups[frozenset({'admin', 'user'})]}")

# Practical use case: group-based permissions

group2: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"Bob", "Charlie"})
overlap: set[str] = set(group1) & set(group2)
print(f"Members in both groups: {overlap}")  # {'Bob'}
```
- **Purpose**: Show frozenset as composite hashable data
- **Complexity**: Intermediate (nested data structures)
- **Pedagogical Value**: Understand when nesting is necessary

**Code Example 4: Set vs. Frozenset Comparison**

favorite_colors.add("yellow")  # ✅ Works
print(f"Modified set: {favorite_colors}")

# Can't use as dict key
try:
    color_dict: dict[set[str], int] = {favorite_colors: 1}
except TypeError:

  - Category: Conceptual
  - Bloom's Level: Understand
  - DigComp Area: Problem-Solving (debugging)
  - Measurable at This Level: Student can explain "how circular references prevent deletion and how cycle detector handles them"

**Key Concepts** (max 7):
1. Reference counting — each object tracks how many references point to it
2. Object deletion — when refcount reaches 0, memory is freed immediately
3. Variables holding references — `x = obj` increases refcount
4. Circular references — A references B, B references A (refcount never reaches 0)
5. Garbage collection (cycle detection) — detects and breaks cycles
6. `gc` module — manual GC control and memory profiling
7. When GC runs — generational GC in CPython

**Prerequisites**:
- Lesson 1: Understanding set uniqueness and data structures
- Basic understanding of variables and object creation

**Duration**: 50 minutes

**Content Outline**:
1. **Introduction** (5 min) - Why memory management matters; Python's automatic approach
2. **Concept: Reference Counting** (10 min) - How Python tracks object usage, immediate deletion
3. **Concept: Circular References** (8 min) - When refcount fails, cycle detector solution

**Content Elements**:

**Code Example 1: Reference Counting Basics**
```python
import sys

# Create an object
my_list: list[int] = [1, 2, 3]

# Check reference count (should be 1 for my_list)
print(f"Initial refcount: {sys.getrefcount(my_list)}")  # 2 (variable + getrefcount argument)

# Create another reference
another_ref: list[int] = my_list
print(f"After assignment: {sys.getrefcount(my_list)}")  # 3 (my_list + another_ref + argument)

# Delete one reference
del my_list
print(f"After del my_list: {sys.getrefcount(another_ref)}")  # Still accessible via another_ref

# Delete last reference
del another_ref
# print(f"After del another_ref: {sys.getrefcount(another_ref)}")  # Would error - another_ref doesn't exist!

print("Object was freed when last reference was deleted")

# Practical observation: immediate deletion
x: str = "temporary"
y: str = x
del x
del y  # String is immediately freed here
print("String freed immediately after last reference deleted")
```
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate how Python counts references
- **Complexity**: Intermediate (system-level observation)
- **Pedagogical Value**: Understand "automatic" memory management

**Code Example 2: Circular References (Problem and Solution)**
```python
import gc

# Circular reference - A points to B, B points to A
class Node:
    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
        self.name: str = name
        self.next: Node | None = None

    def __del__(self) -> None:
        print(f"Node {self.name} was deleted")

# Create circular reference
node_a: Node = Node("A")
node_b: Node = Node("B")

node_a.next = node_b  # A points to B
node_b.next = node_a  # B points to A (circular!)

print("Created circular reference (A -> B -> A)")

# Delete variables
del node_a  # A's refcount decreased, but still 1 (B refers to it)
del node_b  # B's refcount decreased, but still 1 (A refers to it)
print("Deleted variables (but objects not freed - circular!)")

# Manual garbage collection detects and breaks cycle
print("Running garbage collection...")
collected: int = gc.collect()
print(f"Garbage collector freed {collected} objects")  # Will show 2

# Now both A and B are deleted
print("Circular references cleaned up!")

# Without gc.collect(), circular references leak memory (rarely matters in practice)
```
- **Purpose**: Show when reference counting fails; demonstrate cycle detection
- **Complexity**: Intermediate (system understanding)
- **Pedagogical Value**: Understand GC necessity

**Code Example 3: The `gc` Module for Memory Analysis**
```python
import gc
import sys

# Disable automatic GC for demonstration

print("=" * 50)
print("Memory profiling with gc module")
print("=" * 50)

# Get initial object count
initial_objects: int = len(gc.get_objects())
print(f"Initial object count: {initial_objects}")

# Create many objects
numbers: list[int] = list(range(10_000))
strings: list[str] = [str(i) for i in range(10_000)]
sets: list[set[int]] = [{i, i+1, i+2} for i in range(1000)]

after_creation: int = len(gc.get_objects())
print(f"After creation: {after_creation}")
print(f"Objects created: {after_creation - initial_objects}")

# Manual collection
collected: int = gc.collect()
print(f"Manual gc.collect() freed {collected} objects")

# Delete objects
del numbers
del strings
del sets

after_deletion: int = len(gc.get_objects())
print(f"After deletion: {after_deletion}")

# Manual collection catches any circular refs
collected: int = gc.collect()
print(f"After cleanup, gc.collect() freed {collected} objects")

# Re-enable GC
gc.enable()

# Get garbage collector stats
stats = gc.get_stats()
print(f"\nGC statistics: {stats}")
```
- **Purpose**: Show `gc` module for memory profiling
- **Complexity**: Intermediate (tool usage)
- **Pedagogical Value**: Learn how to analyze memory

**Code Example 4: Reference Counting in Practice**
```python
import sys

# Function that receives object as argument
def process_data(data: list[int]) -> int:
    # data is referenced inside function
    return sum(data)

my_data: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(f"Before function: refcount = {sys.getrefcount(my_data) - 1}")  # -1 for getrefcount arg

result: int = process_data(my_data)
print(f"After function: refcount = {sys.getrefcount(my_data) - 1}")  # Function reference released

# Key insight: Python automatically manages memory
# Developers rarely need to think about refcount
# Just delete when done, GC handles the rest

print("\nAutomatic memory management in action:")
for i in range(5):
    temp: list[int] = [j for j in range(1_000_000)]  # Create large list
    print(f"Created list {i}, refcount: {sys.getrefcount(temp) - 1}")
    # temp automatically freed when loop iteration ends

print("All temporary lists freed automatically!")
```
- **Purpose**: Show how refcount works in realistic scenarios
- **Complexity**: Intermediate (real-world patterns)
- **Pedagogical Value**: Understand "automatic" nature

**Code Example 5: Generational Garbage Collection**
```python
import gc

# Python uses generational GC (objects start in "young" generation)
print("Garbage Collection Generations:")
print(f"GC enabled: {gc.isenabled()}")

# Get thresholds (when GC triggers)
thresholds: tuple[int, int, int] = gc.get_threshold()
print(f"GC thresholds (gen0, gen1, gen2): {thresholds}")
# Default: (700, 10, 10)
# Means: collect when 700+ objects in gen0, or 10 collections in gen1, etc.

# Manual trigger
gc.collect()
print("Manual garbage collection triggered")

# Get collection counts
counts: tuple[int, ...] = gc.get_count()
print(f"Current collection counts: {counts}")

# Optimization (rarely needed in practice):
# gc.set_threshold(2000, 15, 15)  # Less frequent collections = faster, more memory
# print("Adjusted GC thresholds for less frequent collection")
```
- **Purpose**: Show GC tuning possibilities (advanced)
- **Complexity**: Intermediate (system knowledge)
- **Pedagogical Value**: Understand GC behavior (not for tuning, just awareness)

**Practice Approach**:
- **Exercise 1**: Track refcount as you create and delete variables
- **Exercise 2**: Create and manually break a circular reference
- **Exercise 3**: Use `gc.get_objects()` to count objects before/after
- **Exercise 4**: Create a function that analyzes memory usage of different data structures

**Specification Outline: Memory Profiler Tool**
```
# Memory Profiler Specification

## Goal
Build a tool that tracks Python object creation/deletion and displays memory statistics.

## Requirements
1. Track object creation (when objects are added)
2. Track object deletion (when objects are removed via gc)
3. Display current object count
4. Display peak object count
5. Identify "dead" objects (unreferenced but not yet collected)
6. Show memory statistics

## Input/Output
Input: Create/delete objects in your program
Output: Real-time statistics showing:
- Current object count
- Total objects ever created
- Objects awaiting collection
- Memory estimate

## Technology Constraints
- Use sets to track object IDs
- Use gc module for analysis
- Type hints mandatory
- Testable with realistic scenarios
```

**Code Example 1: Memory Profiler Implementation**
```python
import gc
import sys
from typing import Any

class MemoryProfiler:
    """Tracks object creation and deletion using sets and gc module."""

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        # Use sets to track object IDs (immutable identifiers)
        self.created_objects: set[int] = set()      # IDs of all created objects
        self.deleted_objects: set[int] = set()      # IDs of deleted objects
        self.peak_count: int = 0
        self.start_count: int = len(gc.get_objects())

    def track_object(self, obj: Any) -> None:
        """Track a new object by its id."""
        obj_id: int = id(obj)
        self.created_objects.add(obj_id)

        current_count: int = self.count_living_objects()
        if current_count > self.peak_count:
            self.peak_count = current_count

    def count_living_objects(self) -> int:
        """Count currently living objects."""
        return len(self.created_objects) - len(self.deleted_objects)

    def profile_memory(self) -> dict[str, int]:
        """Analyze current memory state."""
        gc.collect()  # Collect garbage first
        all_objects: list[Any] = gc.get_objects()

        living_count: int = self.count_living_objects()
        total_memory: int = sum(sys.getsizeof(obj) for obj in all_objects)

        return {
            "current_objects": living_count,
            "created_total": len(self.created_objects),
            "deleted_total": len(self.deleted_objects),
            "peak_objects": self.peak_count,
            "memory_bytes": total_memory,
            "unreachable": len(gc.garbage)  # Circular refs
        }

    def print_report(self) -> None:
        """Display memory statistics."""
        stats: dict[str, int] = self.profile_memory()

        print("\n" + "=" * 50)
        print("MEMORY PROFILE REPORT")
        print("=" * 50)
        print(f"Current objects in memory: {stats['current_objects']}")
        print(f"Total objects created: {stats['created_total']}")
        print(f"Total objects deleted: {stats['deleted_total']}")
        print(f"Peak object count: {stats['peak_objects']}")
        print(f"Total memory: {stats['memory_bytes']:,} bytes")
        print(f"Unreachable objects (cycles): {stats['unreachable']}")
        print("=" * 50 + "\n")

# Example usage
profiler: MemoryProfiler = MemoryProfiler()

# Create various objects and track them
numbers: list[int] = [i for i in range(1000)]
profiler.track_object(numbers)

strings: list[str] = [f"string_{i}" for i in range(500)]
profiler.track_object(strings)

sets: list[set[int]] = [{i, i+1, i+2} for i in range(100)]
profiler.track_object(sets)

print("Created objects...")
profiler.print_report()

# Delete and see changes
del numbers
del strings
del sets

print("Deleted objects...")
profiler.print_report()
```
- **Purpose**: Implement capstone tool integrating all chapter concepts
- **Complexity**: Intermediate (integration of multiple concepts)
- **Pedagogical Value**: Practical tool demonstrating learning

**Code Example 2: Advanced Tracking with Frozensets**
```python
class AdvancedMemoryProfiler(MemoryProfiler):
    """Extended profiler with object categorization."""

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        # Use frozensets to track categories (immutable grouping)
        self.categories: dict[frozenset[str], set[int]] = {
            frozenset(["list"]): set(),
            frozenset(["dict"]): set(),
            frozenset(["set"]): set(),
            frozenset(["custom"]): set()
        }

    def track_object_with_type(self, obj: Any) -> None:
        """Track object and categorize by type."""
        self.track_object(obj)

        obj_id: int = id(obj)
        obj_type: str = type(obj).__name__

        if isinstance(obj, list):
            self.categories[frozenset(["list"])].add(obj_id)
        elif isinstance(obj, dict):
            self.categories[frozenset(["dict"])].add(obj_id)
        elif isinstance(obj, set):
            self.categories[frozenset(["set"])].add(obj_id)
        else:
            self.categories[frozenset(["custom"])].add(obj_id)

    def report_by_category(self) -> None:
        """Show object counts by category."""
        print("\nObjects by category:")
        for category, ids in self.categories.items():
            print(f"  {list(category)[0]}: {len(ids)} objects")

# Test
advanced_profiler: AdvancedMemoryProfiler = AdvancedMemoryProfiler()

my_list: list[int] = [1, 2, 3]
my_dict: dict[str, int] = {"a": 1}
my_set: set[int] = {1, 2, 3}

advanced_profiler.track_object_with_type(my_list)
advanced_profiler.track_object_with_type(my_dict)
advanced_profiler.track_object_with_type(my_set)

advanced_profiler.report_by_category()
```
- **Purpose**: Show advanced pattern (frozensets for categorization)
- **Complexity**: Intermediate (extending prior implementation)
- **Pedagogical Value**: Real design pattern application

**Code Example 3: Testing with Edge Cases**
```python
# Test case 1: Circular references
class Node:
    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
        self.name: str = name
        self.next: Node | None = None

def test_circular_references(profiler: MemoryProfiler) -> None:
    """Test that circular references are eventually freed."""
    print("Testing circular references...")

    node_a: Node = Node("A")
    node_b: Node = Node("B")
    node_a.next = node_b
    node_b.next = node_a

    profiler.track_object(node_a)
    profiler.track_object(node_b)

    print(f"Before deletion: {profiler.count_living_objects()} objects")

    del node_a
    del node_b

    gc.collect()  # Trigger cycle detection

    print(f"After deletion & gc: {profiler.count_living_objects()} objects")
    print("✓ Circular references properly freed\n")

# Test case 2: Large object graphs
def test_large_graph(profiler: MemoryProfiler) -> None:
    """Test with many objects."""
    print("Testing large object graph...")

    large_list: list[list[int]] = [[i*j for j in range(100)] for i in range(1000)]
    profiler.track_object(large_list)

    stats: dict[str, int] = profiler.profile_memory()
    print(f"Tracked {len(large_list)} lists, memory: {stats['memory_bytes']:,} bytes")

    del large_list
    gc.collect()

    print("✓ Large graph properly cleaned\n")

# Run tests
profiler: MemoryProfiler = MemoryProfiler()
test_circular_references(profiler)
test_large_graph(profiler)
```

## 🔗 Integration Points

### With Prior Chapters

**Chapter 14 (Data Types)**:
- Type hints syntax established; Chapter 19 applies to collections: `set[int]`, `frozenset[str]`

**Chapter 17 (Control Flow)**:
- Loops used in Lesson 1-2 for iteration; Chapter 19 teaches why sets are better

**Chapter 18 (Lists, Tuples, Dictionary)**:
- Direct comparison: list vs. set trade-offs, tuple as immutable, dict keys now include frozensets

### With Future Chapters

**Chapter 20 (Modules and Functions)**:
- Functions will accept/return sets; Chapter 19 establishes type signatures

**Chapter 24 (OOP Part I)**:
- Custom objects need `__hash__` to be hashable; Chapter 19 lays groundwork

**Chapter 29 (CPython and GIL)**:
- GC discussion extends to GIL implications; Chapter 19 covers basics
