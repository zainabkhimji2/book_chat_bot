- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which learning journey this task belongs to (e.g., LJ1, LJ2, LJ3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Chapter directory**: `book-source/docs/04-Part-4-Python-Fundamentals/19-set-frozenset-gc/`
- **Lesson files**: `01-set-basics.md`, `02-set-operations.md`, etc.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all learning journeys
- **Learning Journeys (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - LJ1 and LJ2 (both P1) can proceed in parallel after Foundation
  - LJ3, LJ4, LJ5 (all P2) can proceed in parallel after LJ1/LJ2
  - LJ6 (P3) depends on LJ1-LJ5 completion (capstone integrates all concepts)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all learning journeys being complete

### Learning Journey Dependencies

- **LJ1 (P1) - Set Fundamentals**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other journeys
- **LJ2 (P1) - Set Operations**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on LJ1 but can be drafted in parallel
- **LJ3 (P2) - Set Internals**: Depends on LJ1 (must understand sets before internals)
- **LJ4 (P2) - Frozensets**: Depends on LJ1 (must understand sets before frozensets)
- **LJ5 (P2) - Garbage Collection**: Depends on LJ1 (sets used in examples)
- **LJ6 (P3) - Capstone**: Depends on ALL prior journeys (integrates all concepts)

### Within Each Learning Journey

- Introduction before concept sections
- Concept sections before code examples
- Code examples before practice exercises
- Practice exercises before "Try With AI" section
- CoLearning elements interspersed throughout
- Validation tasks at end of each lesson

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks (T001-T003) can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks (T004-T006) can run in parallel within Phase 2
- LJ1 and LJ2 (Lessons 1-2) can be drafted in parallel after Foundation
- LJ3, LJ4, LJ5 (Lessons 3-5) can be drafted in parallel after LJ1/LJ2 complete
- Within a lesson: Code examples can be written in parallel before integration
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Learning Journey 1 (Lesson 1)

```bash
# After writing introduction and concept sections, launch code examples in parallel:
Task: "Add Code Example 1: Creating Sets with Type Hints in 01-set-basics.md"
Task: "Add Code Example 2: Understanding Uniqueness in 01-set-basics.md"
Task: "Add Code Example 3: Modifying Sets in 01-set-basics.md"
Task: "Add Code Example 4: Hashability Requirement in 01-set-basics.md"

# After code examples, complete practice and validation sequentially
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Learning Journey 1 Only - Lesson 1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all lessons)
3. Complete Phase 3: Learning Journey 1 (Lesson 1: Set Basics)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run technical-reviewer on Lesson 1
5. If validated, proceed to LJ2; if issues, revise Lesson 1

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Chapter structure ready
2. Add LJ1 (Lesson 1) → Validate → Publish (Students can start!)
3. Add LJ2 (Lesson 2) → Validate → Publish (Set operations available)
4. Add LJ3-LJ5 (Lessons 3-5) → Validate → Publish (Intermediate concepts)
5. Add LJ6 (Lesson 6 Capstone) → Validate → Publish (Complete chapter!)
6. Each lesson adds value without breaking previous lessons

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple content creators:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Writer A: Learning Journey 1 (Lesson 1)
   - Writer B: Learning Journey 2 (Lesson 2)
3. After LJ1/LJ2 complete:
   - Writer A: Learning Journey 3 (Lesson 3)
   - Writer B: Learning Journey 4 (Lesson 4)
   - Writer C: Learning Journey 5 (Lesson 5)
4. After LJ3-LJ5 complete:
   - Writer A: Learning Journey 6 (Lesson 6 - Capstone)
5. Team validates together

## Notes

### Content Policy for Lesson Authors

**CRITICAL - Lesson Closure Standard**:
- Within this chapter, each lesson MUST end with a single final section titled "Try With AI"
- NO "Key Takeaways" sections (violates Constitution Rule 6)
- NO "What's Next" sections (unless chapter-level in intro.md)
- NO separate conclusion sections beyond "Try With AI"

**AI Tool Selection**:
- Before AI tools are taught (Part 1): Use ChatGPT web in "Try With AI" section
- After tool onboarding (Parts 2+): Instruct learners to use their preferred AI companion (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, ChatGPT web)
- Optionally provide CLI and web variants for prompts

### Format Requirements

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [LJ#] label maps task to specific learning journey for traceability
- Each learning journey should produce an independently completable and testable lesson
- Validate cognitive load, reading level, and constitutional compliance for each lesson
- Commit after each lesson or logical group of tasks
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate lesson independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-journey dependencies that break independence

### Validation Gates

- After each lesson: Technical-reviewer for code quality and pedagogical effectiveness
- After all lessons: Proof-validator for publication readiness
- Chapter-level: Constitutional compliance check (all 17 principles)
- Reading level: Grade 7-8 (Flesch-Kincaid 7.0-8.0)
- Cognitive load: A2 max 7 concepts, B1 max 10 concepts per lesson

---

**Total Tasks**: 101
- Setup: 3 tasks
- Foundational: 3 tasks
- Learning Journey 1 (Lesson 1): 14 tasks
- Learning Journey 2 (Lesson 2): 17 tasks
- Learning Journey 3 (Lesson 3): 16 tasks
- Learning Journey 4 (Lesson 4): 13 tasks
- Learning Journey 5 (Lesson 5): 15 tasks
- Learning Journey 6 (Lesson 6 - Capstone): 12 tasks
- Polish: 8 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 25+ tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases

**MVP Scope**: Complete Phase 1-3 (Learning Journey 1 / Lesson 1) for minimal viable chapter (students can start learning sets)

**Full Chapter Completion**: All phases (1-9) for complete, production-ready Chapter 19 with 6 lessons and capstone project
