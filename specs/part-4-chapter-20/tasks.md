**Estimated Critical Path Time**: 50–60 hours

## Parallel Execution Strategy

**Maximum Parallelization** (for lesson-writer subagent team approach):

1. **Phase 1-2 Sequential** (setup requires order)
2. **Phase 3 Sequential** (Lesson 1 foundational, code examples can run in parallel once lesson text is written)
3. **Phase 4 Parallel** (Lesson 2 + Lesson 3 can be written in parallel; code examples [T021-T024] and [T029-T031] parallel)
4. **Phase 5 Parallel** (Lesson 4 + Lesson 5 can be written in parallel; code examples in each lesson parallel)
5. **Phase 6 Parallel** (validation tasks independent)

**Recommended Team Split** (if using multiple lesson-writer subagents):
- **Agent A**: Lesson 1 (T010-T018)
- **Agent B**: Lesson 2 (T019-T026)
- **Agent C**: Lesson 3 (T027-T033)
- **Agent D**: Lesson 4 (T034-T040)
- **Agent E**: Lesson 5 Capstone (T041-T049)
- **Agent F**: Validation & Polish (T050-T054)

## Notes for Implementation

**Pedagogical Ordering Rules** (CRITICAL - enforce in every task):
1. Each lesson uses ONLY concepts from current + prior lessons (NO forward references)
2. Every function/keyword introduced with explanation before first use
3. Built-ins (len, type, isinstance) vs methods (.upper, .split) clearly distinguished
4. Lesson boundaries strictly enforced (L1 concepts not used until L1 is complete)

**AI-Native Learning** (CRITICAL - embed in all lessons):
- Every lesson demonstrates AI as intellectual partner, not code generator
- 💬 Conceptual prompts encourage exploration
- 🎓 Commentary emphasizes reasoning ("syntax cheap, semantics gold")
- 🚀 Challenges practice specification-driven thinking
- ✨ Tips build AI collaboration patterns

**Try With AI Format** (CRITICAL - exact compliance required):
- Exactly 4 prompts per lesson
- Progressive Bloom's levels: Remember → Understand → Apply → Analyze/Synthesize
- Each prompt with explicit "Expected outcome"
- NO "Key Takeaways", "Summary", or "What's Next" sections after Try With AI
- Try With AI is the ONLY closure point for each lesson

**Type Hints** (MANDATORY - all code examples):
- Every function: `def func(param: Type) -> ReturnType:`
- No ambiguous untyped functions
- Python 3.14+ modern syntax (list[int], dict[str, float], X | None)
