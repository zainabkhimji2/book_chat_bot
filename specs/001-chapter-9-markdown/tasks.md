---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Collaborate on Specifications Using GitHub (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Students can create professional README.md files for GitHub that render correctly

**Independent Test**: Student creates README.md with standard sections (Title, Description, Installation, Usage) → pushes to GitHub → formatted README displays on repository homepage (SC-003: 80%+ achieve this)

**Lessons Covering US3**: Lessons 7-8 (Tier 3 orchestration + Full AIDD integration)

### Lesson 7: Scaling Markdown with AI Orchestration (Tier 3)

- [ ] T028 [US3] Write lesson 7 content in `07-scaling-markdown-orchestration.md` covering:
  - Concept 1: Orchestration mindset (you define STRATEGY, AI executes TACTICS)
  - Concept 2: Consistency principle (when generating multiple files, ensure uniform structure)
  - Concept 3: Scaling operations (10+ files, bulk conversions, multi-component documentation)
  - Teaching approach: When to orchestrate vs. manually create (threshold: 5+ similar items)
  - Code Example 1: Directing AI to generate 5 README files for multi-module project (specification: "Generate README.md for each of these 5 folders: [list]. Use sections: Title, Description, Installation, Usage. Customize content based on folder purpose.")
  - Code Example 2: Converting 10 .txt notes to markdown (specification: "Convert all files in /notes folder from .txt to .md. Detect headings from ALL CAPS lines. Detect code from indented blocks.")
  - Code Example 3: Creating Docusaurus site structure (specification: "Create docs/ folder with 3 chapters, each containing 3 lessons as separate .md files. Use naming: 01-chapter-name/01-lesson-name.md")

  - YAML frontmatter: `duration: 50min`, `proficiency: B1`, `concepts: 3`, `skills: [Orchestrating AI Generation (B1 - Create), Ensuring Consistency (B1 - Evaluate), Directing AI Strategy (B1 - Analyze)]`
- [ ] T029 [US3] Add "Try With AI" section to lesson 7: Student orchestrates "Generate complete documentation for [student's project] with 5 pages following standard structure" → validates consistency across generated files
- [ ] T030 [US3] Create orchestration request templates in `examples/orchestration-prompts.md` for lesson 7: Batch README generation template, bulk conversion template, site structure template
- [ ] T031 [US3] Create consistency validation checklist for lesson 7: All files have same section headings? Content customized (not copy-paste)? Formatting uniform? Links work?

### Lesson 8: Full AIDD Cycle - Final Integration Project (MVP Demonstration)

- [ ] T032 [US3] Write lesson 8 content in `08-full-aidd-cycle.md` covering:
  - Concept 1: Full AIDD workflow (Write spec in markdown → AI generates code → Validate output → Identify gaps → Refine spec → Re-generate)
  - Integration: All skills from Lessons 1-7 applied in complete workflow
  - Real-world context: This is how professional developers work with AI coding agents
  - **Major Exercise**: 5-step AIDD cycle
    - Step 1: Write specification for simple CLI tool (e.g., "Todo list app with add, list, delete commands") using all Tier 1 markdown (headings, features list, expected output code block, reference links)
    - Step 2: Submit spec to AI agent (ChatGPT web: "Implement this specification") → receive generated Python code
    - Step 3: Validate code (Does it match spec? Are all features present? Does expected output match?)
    - Step 4: Identify gaps (What's missing? What doesn't match spec?)
    - Step 5: Refine specification → re-submit → validate improved output
  - GitHub integration: Create repository → add generated code → create README.md (Tier 1 markdown) → push → verify rendering
  - Exercise acceptance criteria: Complete 5-step cycle documented, GitHub repo created with README.md rendering correctly (SC-003), reflection on what markdown clarity improved AI output quality
  - YAML frontmatter: `duration: 60min`, `proficiency: B1+`, `concepts: 1`, `skills: [Completing Full AIDD Cycle (B1 - Create), Validating Code Against Spec (B1 - Evaluate), Iterative Spec Refinement (B1 - Analyze), Understanding Intent Layer (B1 - Understand)]`
- [ ] T033 [US3] Add "Try With AI" section to lesson 8: Student completes full AIDD cycle with their own project idea (not provided example) → documents cycle → shares GitHub repo link
- [ ] T034 [US3] Create AIDD cycle worksheet in `examples/aidd-cycle-worksheet.md` for lesson 8 major exercise: Structured template with sections for each step (Spec v1, Generated Code, Validation Notes, Gap Analysis, Spec v2, Improved Code)
- [ ] T035 [US3] Create assessment rubric for lesson 8 (SC-005 validation): Spec v1 complete (20%), Code generated (15%), Validation documented (20%), Gaps identified (20%), Spec refined (15%), GitHub README renders (10%)
- [ ] T036 [US3] Create GitHub submission checklist for lesson 8 (SC-003 + SC-011 validation): Repository created? README.md present? Headings render correctly? Lists format correctly? Code blocks highlight correctly? Links work?

**Checkpoint**: All user stories (US1, US2, US3) complete and independently functional. Students have portfolio evidence (GitHub repo with README) demonstrating markdown mastery.

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements and validation that affect all lessons

- [ ] T037 [P] Add "Common Mistakes" sidebar callouts to all 8 lessons referencing `examples/common-errors.md` (empty headings in lesson 2, unclosed code blocks in lesson 4, invalid links in lesson 5, etc.)
- [ ] T038 [P] Verify all 8 lessons end with ONLY "Try With AI" section (no separate "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next" sections per constitution)
- [ ] T039 [P] Verify all YAML frontmatter includes skills metadata fields: `skills: [{name, cefr_level, bloom_level, digcomp_area, measurable_outcome}]`
- [ ] T040 [P] Add cross-references between lessons: Lesson 5 references 2-4, Lesson 6 references 2-5, Lesson 8 references all previous
- [ ] T041 Validate reading level for all lessons using Flesch-Kincaid test (SC-008): Target Grade 7-8, flag any lessons above Grade 9 for simplification
- [ ] T042 [P] Create end-of-chapter quiz in `examples/chapter-quiz.md` covering: Syntax patterns (30%), Tier 1 vs 2 vs 3 usage (30%), AIDD workflow understanding (30%), Real-world application (10%) - 20 questions, passing score 80% (SC-007)
- [ ] T043 Verify all code examples in all lessons tested for correctness: Markdown renders as expected, language tags work, links are valid
- [ ] T044 [P] Create chapter introduction page explaining three-tier structure and how lessons build on each other
- [ ] T045 Validate constitutional compliance across all lessons: Tier 1 teaches directly (not "ask your AI")? Tier 2 teaches specification pattern? Tier 3 teaches orchestration? Max 5 concepts per section?

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all lesson writing
- **User Stories (Phases 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - Lessons within US1 (Lessons 1-5): Sequential (1→2→3→4→5) due to progressive skill building
  - US2 (Lesson 6): Can start after Foundational, integrates with US1 skills
  - US3 (Lessons 7-8): Lesson 7 can start after Foundational, Lesson 8 depends on Lessons 1-7
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all lessons being written

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Write Specs)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
  - Lessons 1-5 build progressively: Foundation → Headings → Lists → Code Blocks → Emphasis & Links → First Complete Spec
- **User Story 2 (P2 - Read AI Output)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates US1 skills but independently testable via quiz
  - Lesson 6 applies US1 skills in new context (reading AI responses vs writing specs)
- **User Story 3 (P3 - GitHub Collaboration)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates US1 + US2 but independently testable via GitHub submission
  - Lesson 7 applies orchestration mindset (new skill)
  - Lesson 8 synthesizes all skills in complete AIDD cycle

### Within Each User Story

- **US1 (Lessons 1-5)**: Sequential execution required (each lesson builds on previous)
  - Lesson 1 (foundation) must complete before Lesson 2
  - Lesson 2 (headings) must complete before Lesson 3
  - Lesson 3 (lists) must complete before Lesson 4
  - Lesson 4 (code blocks) must complete before Lesson 5
  - Lesson 5 (integration) must complete to satisfy US1 acceptance criteria
- **US2 (Lesson 6)**: Single lesson, no internal dependencies
- **US3 (Lessons 7-8)**: Lesson 8 depends on Lesson 7 and all previous lessons

### Parallel Opportunities

- Setup tasks (T001-T003): All marked [P] can run in parallel
- Foundational tasks (T004-T006): All marked [P] can run in parallel
- Within US1:
  - Lesson 1 writing (T007-T009): Sequential within lesson but can start immediately after Foundational
  - Lessons 2-4: Each lesson's tasks (T010-T012, T013-T015, T016-T018) can be parallelized if multiple authors
  - However, lessons MUST be completed in order due to progressive scaffolding
- US2 Lesson 6 tasks (T023-T027): Can parallelize sample creation, quiz creation, exercise template
- US3 tasks: Lesson 7 (T028-T031) and partial Lesson 8 (T032) can be parallelized if different authors
- Polish tasks (T037-T045): Most marked [P] can run in parallel across all lessons

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch all foundational tasks together:
Task: "Create common mistakes reference in examples/common-errors.md"
Task: "Create validation guide in examples/validation-checklist.md"
Task: "Create syntax quick reference in examples/syntax-reference.md"

# All three support files can be created simultaneously
```

## Parallel Example: Lesson 6 (User Story 2)

```bash
# Launch all support materials for lesson 6 together:
Task: "Create sample AI responses in examples/ai-response-samples.md"
Task: "Create comprehension quiz with 10 questions"
Task: "Create exercise acceptance criteria rubric"

# Main lesson content (T023) can be written while support materials are being created
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only - Lessons 1-5)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T006) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T007-T022) - Lessons 1-5
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test lesson 5 major exercise independently
   - Can students write valid spec.md with all Tier 1 elements?
   - Does AI successfully generate code from student specs?
   - SC-001 validation: 90%+ achieve success?
5. Deploy/demo Lessons 1-5 if ready (students can now write specifications)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add Lessons 1-5 (US1) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Students can write specs - MVP!)
3. Add Lesson 6 (US2) → Test independently via quiz → Deploy/Demo (Students can read AI output)
4. Add Lessons 7-8 (US3) → Test independently via GitHub submission → Deploy/Demo (Students can collaborate on GitHub + complete AIDD cycle)
5. Polish phase → Final validation → Complete chapter ready

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple content creators:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (6 tasks)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Author A**: Lessons 1-2 (Foundation + Headings) - T007-T012
   - **Author B**: Lessons 3-4 (Lists + Code Blocks) - T013-T018
   - **Author C**: Lesson 5 (Integration + Major Exercise) - T019-T022
   - **Author D**: Lesson 6 (Tier 2 + Quiz) - T023-T027
   - **Author E**: Lessons 7-8 (Tier 3 + AIDD Cycle) - T028-T036
3. Lessons complete sequentially within each author's domain, integrate independently for testing

## Notes

### AI Native Teaching Methodology Integration

**This task list implements AI-Native Teaching across three tiers**:

1. **Tier 1 (Lessons 2-5)**: Book teaches foundational markdown syntax directly
   - Tasks T010-T022 ensure content demonstrates syntax with clear examples
   - Students practice manually (not "ask your AI what is a heading")
   - Validation: Students can write markdown without AI assistance

2. **Tier 2 (Lesson 6)**: AI Companion handles complex syntax
   - Tasks T023-T027 teach specification-driven requests to AI
   - Students specify WHAT they need → AI generates complex syntax → Students validate
   - Focus: Understanding when to delegate complexity to AI

3. **Tier 3 (Lesson 7)**: AI Orchestration for scaling operations
   - Tasks T028-T031 teach strategic direction of AI for multi-file work
   - Students define patterns and structure → AI executes repetitive work → Students ensure consistency
   - Focus: Orchestration mindset for large-scale tasks

4. **Integration (Lesson 8)**: Full AIDD workflow synthesis
   - Tasks T032-T036 demonstrate complete cycle: Spec → AI Implementation → Validation
   - Combines all three tiers in real-world application
   - Portfolio evidence: GitHub repository with professional README

### Lesson Closure Policy

**CRITICAL**: All lessons MUST end with single "Try With AI" section only.

- **Before AI tools taught** (Chapters 1-9): "Try With AI" uses ChatGPT web
- **After tool onboarding** (Chapters 10+): Instruct use of preferred tool (Gemini CLI, Claude CLI), optionally provide CLI and web variants
- **NO** separate "Key Takeaways" section
- **NO** separate "What's Next" section
- Constitution Principle 1 enforces this structure

### Task Format Compliance

- [P] marker: Different files, no dependencies within phase
- [Story] label: Maps to user stories from spec.md (US1, US2, US3)
- Exact file paths included in all task descriptions
- All tasks follow checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with path`

### Success Criteria Tracking

Tasks map directly to spec.md success criteria:

- **SC-001** (90%+ write specs): T022 assessment rubric for lesson 5 exercise
- **SC-002** (85%+ read AI output): T026 comprehension quiz for lesson 6
- **SC-003** (80%+ GitHub README): T036 GitHub submission checklist for lesson 8
- **SC-004** (75%+ direct AI complex markdown): T027 exercise validation for lesson 6
- **SC-005** (Full AIDD cycle): T035 assessment rubric for lesson 8
- **SC-007** (80%+ pass chapter quiz): T042 end-of-chapter quiz
- **SC-008** (Grade 7-8 reading level): T041 Flesch-Kincaid validation
- **SC-009** (70%+ completion rate): Tracked post-publication
- **SC-010** (80%+ submit "Try With AI"): Tracked post-publication
- **SC-011** (GitHub portfolio): T036 validates this outcome

### Independent Testing Per User Story

- **US1 Independent Test**: Lesson 5 exercise submission (T022 rubric)
- **US2 Independent Test**: Lesson 6 comprehension quiz (T026 passing score 75%+)
- **US3 Independent Test**: Lesson 8 GitHub submission (T036 checklist)

Each story delivers measurable value independently:
- Complete US1 only → Students can write specifications (foundation skill)
- Complete US1+US2 → Students can also read/validate AI output (safety skill)
- Complete US1+US2+US3 → Students can collaborate on GitHub + complete full AIDD cycle (professional workflow)
