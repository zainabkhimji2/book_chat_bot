# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 9 - Markdown: The Language of AI Communication

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - ✅ Spec describes WHAT students learn, not HOW markdown is rendered technically
  - ✅ Focus on user-facing skills: writing specs, reading AI output, GitHub collaboration
  - ✅ No mention of specific rendering engines or parser implementations

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - ✅ P1: Specification writing (foundation of AIDD methodology)
  - ✅ P2: Validation of AI outputs (safety and learning)
  - ✅ P3: Real-world GitHub workflow (professional skill)

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - ✅ User stories describe learning outcomes without jargon
  - ✅ "Student can write specifications" (not "Student can parse AST")
  - ✅ Prerequisites and context clearly stated

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - ✅ User Scenarios & Testing (3 prioritized stories with acceptance scenarios)
  - ✅ Requirements (24 functional requirements organized by tier)
  - ✅ Success Criteria (11 measurable outcomes)
  - ✅ Assumptions (10 documented assumptions)

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - ✅ Zero clarification markers in spec
  - ✅ All scope decisions made based on book constitution and chapter context

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - ✅ FR-001 to FR-009: Tier 1 skills (observable: student creates markdown with X syntax)
  - ✅ FR-010 to FR-012: Tier 2 skills (observable: student directs AI to create Y)
  - ✅ FR-013 to FR-015: Tier 3 skills (observable: student orchestrates Z operation)
  - ✅ FR-016 to FR-019: AIDD integration (testable via end-to-end exercise)
  - ✅ FR-020 to FR-024: Constitution compliance (verifiable in lesson content)

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - ✅ SC-001 to SC-004: Percentages with assessment methods (exercise submissions, quizzes, GitHub links)
  - ✅ SC-005 to SC-006: Observable outcomes (demonstrated in projects)
  - ✅ SC-007 to SC-008: Quantitative metrics (quiz pass rate, readability scores)
  - ✅ SC-009 to SC-010: Engagement metrics (completion rates)
  - ✅ SC-011: Portfolio evidence (GitHub repositories)

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
  - ✅ "Students can write specifications" (not "Students can use VS Code")
  - ✅ "AI agent successfully generates code" (not "Claude API returns 200")
  - ✅ "GitHub displays formatted README" (user-facing outcome, not implementation)

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - ✅ User Story 1: 4 Given-When-Then scenarios (spec writing workflow)
  - ✅ User Story 2: 3 Given-When-Then scenarios (reading AI output)
  - ✅ User Story 3: 3 Given-When-Then scenarios (GitHub collaboration)

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - ✅ 7 common beginner mistakes documented with explanations
  - ✅ Empty headings, unclosed code blocks, invalid links, nested formatting, special characters, heading levels, mixed list markers

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - ✅ IN SCOPE: Essential markdown for AIDD (specifications, AI communication, GitHub)
  - ✅ OUT OF SCOPE: Advanced flavors, HTML-in-markdown, custom renderers, editor comparisons
  - ✅ Complexity tier explicit: Beginner (Parts 1-3)

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - ✅ Prerequisites: Chapters 1-8 (AIDD intro, tools, Bash, Git)
  - ✅ 10 documented assumptions (tool availability, learning environment, markdown flavor, pedagogical approach, etc.)

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - ✅ Tier 1 (FR-001 to FR-009): Student can demonstrate syntax in exercises
  - ✅ Tier 2 (FR-010 to FR-012): Student can direct AI via prompts
  - ✅ Tier 3 (FR-013 to FR-015): Student can orchestrate multi-file operations
  - ✅ AIDD integration (FR-016 to FR-019): End-to-end workflow completion
  - ✅ Constitution (FR-020 to FR-024): Verifiable in lesson design

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - ✅ P1: Writing specifications (core AIDD skill)
  - ✅ P2: Reading/validating AI output (safety requirement)
  - ✅ P3: GitHub collaboration (real-world application)
  - ✅ All three stories independently testable

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - ✅ 90%+ can write specs (SC-001) ← addresses P1 user story
  - ✅ 85%+ can read AI output (SC-002) ← addresses P2 user story
  - ✅ 80%+ create GitHub READMEs (SC-003) ← addresses P3 user story
  - ✅ 75%+ direct AI for complex markdown (SC-004) ← addresses Tier 2 skills
  - ✅ Full AIDD cycle completion (SC-005) ← integrates all three tiers

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - ✅ No mention of: parser libraries, rendering engines, specific editors, markdown AST
  - ✅ Focus on: student capabilities, learning outcomes, AIDD workflow integration
  - ✅ Success criteria are user-facing (what students can DO, not how system works internally)

## Validation Status: ✅ PASSED

**Summary**: Specification is complete, testable, and ready for planning phase (`/sp.plan`).

**Key Strengths**:
1. Clear three-tier structure aligned with Constitution Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching Pattern)
2. All requirements testable and measurable
3. Success criteria technology-agnostic and user-focused
4. Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (informed assumptions documented)
5. AIDD workflow integration explicit (markdown as specification language)
6. Beginner cognitive load limits enforced (max 5 concepts per section, max 2 options)

**Next Steps**:
- ✅ Spec approved → Proceed to `/sp.plan`
- Plan will break down into lesson-by-lesson structure
- Then `/sp.tasks` to generate implementation checklist
