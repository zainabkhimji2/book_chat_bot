# Specification Quality Checklist: Mobile Responsive & UX Improvements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - ✓ Spec uses Docusaurus/CSS as assumptions, not prescriptions
  - ✓ Focuses on outcomes (responsive layout, touch targets) not HOW (media queries, flexbox)

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - ✓ All stories emphasize user pain points (text overflow, navigation overlap, small buttons)
  - ✓ Clear business value: accessibility, WCAG compliance, reduced bounce rate

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - ✓ Language is clear and explains "why" (e.g., "44x44px touch targets prevent errors")
  - ✓ No technical jargon without explanation

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - ✓ User Scenarios & Testing ✓
  - ✓ Requirements ✓
  - ✓ Success Criteria ✓

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - ✓ All unclear aspects resolved with informed defaults

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - ✓ Each FR is measurable (e.g., "no horizontal scrolling", "44x44px touch targets")
  - ✓ Each acceptance scenario uses Given-When-Then format

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - ✓ All SC include specific metrics: 375px width, 44x44px, 16px gap, 45-75 chars
  - ✓ SC-007 includes Lighthouse score threshold (≥90)
  - ✓ SC-009 references WCAG 2.1 AA standards

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
  - ✓ Uses user-facing metrics, not technical implementations
  - ✓ Example: "Mobile users can read 100% of content without horizontal scrolling" (not "CSS media queries")

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - ✓ 4 user stories with 2-3 acceptance scenarios each
  - ✓ Each story independently testable

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - ✓ Small device handling (320px)
  - ✓ Device rotation (portrait/landscape)
  - ✓ Dark mode contrast
  - ✓ OS-level text scaling accessibility

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - ✓ In Scope: Preface page, responsive CSS, navigation, touch targets, typography
  - ✓ Out of Scope: JS changes, content rewriting, full-site audit, new design system
  - ✓ Focus is narrow: Preface page as MVP, then pattern for other pages

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - ✓ 6 explicit assumptions documented
  - ✓ 3 key dependencies listed (Docusaurus, build pipeline, testing tools)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - ✓ Each FR maps to one or more SCs
  - ✓ Example: FR-001 (no horizontal scrolling) → SC-001 (100% readable at 375px)

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - ✓ P1 (Critical): Text readability, navigation separation, touch target sizing
  - ✓ P2 (Important): Multi-device adaptation, visual element scaling
  - ✓ Coverage includes common use cases: reading on phone, navigating, tapping buttons

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - ✓ 10 specific, measurable success criteria provided
  - ✓ Mix of functional (no horizontal scrolling) and quality (WCAG AA) metrics

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - ✓ Tested by searching for: CSS keywords, framework names, code patterns
  - ✓ Only mentions CSS/Docusaurus in Assumptions (appropriate context)

## Status

**✅ SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

All quality gates passed. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. Specification is complete, testable, and ready for `/sp.plan`.

### Notes

- Prioritization is clear: 3 P1 stories (blockers) + 1 P2 story (improvement)
- Edge cases address real mobile scenarios (device rotation, accessibility settings)
- Risk mitigation strategies are concrete and actionable
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is well-integrated throughout requirements and success criteria
