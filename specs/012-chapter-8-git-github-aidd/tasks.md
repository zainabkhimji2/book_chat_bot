# Chapter 8: Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development — Task Checklist

**Chapter Type**: Technical/Hybrid (Concepts + Hands-on AIDD)

**Status**: Ready for Development

**Feature Branch**: `012-chapter-8-git-github-aidd`

**Owner**: [To be assigned - lesson-writer subagent]

**Estimated Effort**: 29-42 hours (writing 22-31h + review 7-11h)

**Note**: Reduced from original 39-52h due to: (1) Shorter lessons (15-20 min vs 25-30 min), (2) 3 IDE options instead of 4, (3) Installation links instead of screenshots, (4) Simplified capstone for non-coders

**Part**: Part 2 - AI Tool Landscape

**Lesson Duration Standard**: Each lesson 15-20 minutes (total: 175 min = 3 hours)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (User Story 1 - P1)
**Minimum Viable Chapter**: Lessons 1-4 (Git Safety Basics)
- Install Git, configure locally
- Core workflow: init, status, add, commit, push
- Safety: undo changes, understand risks
- AI prompts: natural language Git operations

**Why this is MVP**: Students can safely work with AI assistants using Git locally. GitHub (US2), IDE (US3), and PRs (US4) are enhancements but not blocking.

### User Story Completion Order
1. **US1** (P1): Git Safety Basics → Lessons 1-4
2. **US2** (P2): GitHub Integration → Lessons 6
3. **US3** (P2): IDE Setup → Lesson 8
4. **US4** (P3): Pull Requests → Lesson 7
5. **Integration**: Branching (Lesson 5) + Capstone (Lesson 9)

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- **Lessons 1-4** can be written in parallel (independent concepts)
- **Lessons 6, 7, 8** can be written in parallel after Lesson 5 complete (share branching prerequisite)
- Installation guides (Windows, Mac, Linux) can be written in parallel
- IDE sections (VS Code, Cursor, Zed) can be written in parallel

---

## Task List by Phase

### Phase 1: Setup - Content Structure & Chapter Scaffolding

## Dependencies and Execution Order

### User Story Dependencies
- **US1 (P1)** → No dependencies (can start immediately)
- **US2 (P2)** → Requires US1 complete (need Git basics before GitHub)
- **US3 (P2)** → Requires US1 complete (need Git installed before IDE integration)
- **US4 (P3)** → Requires US2 complete (need GitHub account before PRs)
- **Integration (Lesson 5)** → Requires US1 complete (need Git basics before branching)
- **Capstone (Lesson 9)** → Requires US1, US2, Integration complete (applies all skills)

### Lesson Completion Order
**Critical Path** (must be sequential):
1. Lesson 1 → Lesson 2 → Lesson 3 → Lesson 4 (US1 foundation)
2. Lesson 5 (Integration - branching)
3. Lesson 6 (US2 - GitHub)
4. Lesson 7 (US4 - PRs, depends on Lesson 6)
5. Lesson 9 (Capstone, applies all previous lessons)

**Parallel Path** (can be done independently):
- Lesson 8 (US3 - IDE) can be written in parallel with Lessons 6-7 after Lesson 5 complete

### Parallel Execution Examples

**Phase 1: Foundation (Sequential)**
```
Week 1, Day 1-2: T004-T006 (Lesson 1) → Sequential
Week 1, Day 3-4: T007-T013 (Lesson 2) → T008, T009, T010 parallel (platform guides)
Week 1, Day 5: T014-T017 (Lesson 3) → Sequential
```

**Phase 2: Core Skills (Sequential)**
```
Week 2, Day 1: T018-T020 (Lesson 4) → Sequential
Week 2, Day 2: T021-T023 (Lesson 5 - branching) → Sequential
```

**Phase 3: Advanced Topics (Some Parallel)**
```
Week 2, Day 3: T024-T029 (Lesson 6 - GitHub) → Sequential
Week 2, Day 4-5: PARALLEL:
  - T030-T034 (Lesson 7 - PRs) | AND
  - T035-T043 (Lesson 8 - IDE): T036-T039 parallel (IDE guides)
```

**Phase 4: Integration (Sequential)**
```
Week 3, Day 1: T044-T049 (Lesson 9 - Capstone) → Sequential
```

**Phase 5: Polish (All Parallel)**
```
Week 3, Day 2-3: T050-T062 → All tasks can run in parallel (different files, validation checks)
```

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 62 tasks
- Setup: 3 tasks
- US1 (Git Safety Basics): 17 tasks (Lessons 1-4)
- Integration (Branching): 3 tasks (Lesson 5)
- US2 (GitHub Integration): 6 tasks (Lesson 6)
- US4 (Pull Requests): 5 tasks (Lesson 7)
- US3 (IDE Setup): 9 tasks (Lesson 8)
- Capstone: 6 tasks (Lesson 9)
- Polish: 13 tasks

**Parallelizable Tasks**: 33 tasks marked [P]

**MVP Scope**: Tasks T001-T020 (Setup + US1 Lessons 1-4)

**Estimated Effort**: 29-42 hours
- Writing: 22-31 hours (9 lessons × 2-3h avg, reduced from 30-39h)
- Review: 7-11 hours (link verification, testing, polish, reduced from 9-13h)

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Platform installation guides (Windows, Mac, Linux) - 3 parallel
- IDE guides (VS Code, Cursor, Zed) - 3 parallel
- Lessons 7 and 8 after Lesson 6 complete - 2 parallel
- All polish tasks - 13 parallel

**Success Metrics** (from spec):
- 90% initialize repo, commit, undo via AI prompts within 30 min
- 85% create GitHub account and push project within 1 hour
- 90% install Git successfully on all platforms
- 80% install and configure IDE with Git within 30 min
- 80% use Git branches to test AI changes safely
- 95% identify when to commit before AI changes
- 75% set up IDE with Git and AI extensions
- 70% create PR with AI assistance documented
- Reading level: Grade 7 or below (Flesch-Kincaid)
- Post-chapter confidence: 4.5/5 or higher on "I can safely experiment with AI using Git"

## Notes for Lesson Writers

1. **Lesson Ending Policy**: Each lesson MUST end with a single "Try With AI" section. No additional "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next" sections. Before AI tools are taught (Part 1), use ChatGPT web; after tool onboarding, instruct learners to use their preferred AI tool (Gemini CLI, Claude Code).

2. **Duration Constraint**: Each lesson is 15-20 minutes. Be concise. Focus on essential concepts only. Lesson 1 is 15 min (conceptual), Lessons 2-9 are 20 min each.

3. **Cognitive Load (Tier 1)**: Max 5 new concepts per lesson section. Max 2-3 options presented. For IDE, present exactly 3 options (VS Code, Cursor, Zed - no PyCharm).

4. **Installation Guidance**: Use installation links + text descriptions. NO screenshot requirements. Links must be direct and current.

5. **AI Generates Code**: In capstone (Lesson 9), emphasize AI generates ALL code. Students manage Git workflow only. No coding knowledge assumed.

6. **Natural Language Prompts**: Include prompt templates students can use with AI assistants. Test prompts with real AI tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI).

7. **Safety First**: Explicit warnings for destructive Git commands (reset --hard). Teach "commit before major AI changes" pattern throughout.

8. **Constitution Alignment**: Follow evals-first, spec-first, validation-first principles. All content teaches AI as co-reasoning partner, not just coding assistant.

## Ready for Implementation

This task checklist is ready for the lesson-writer subagent. All tasks are specific, have clear acceptance criteria, and include exact file paths. Lessons are organized by user story priority for incremental delivery.

**Next Step**: Invoke lesson-writer subagent with this task list and plan.md to begin implementation.
