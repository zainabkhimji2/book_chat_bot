## Key Corrections Made

### From Original Chapter to Redesigned Chapter

| Item | Original | Corrected | Lesson |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Lesson 1 Content | Overlapped with Chapter 1 specs | SMART acceptance criteria (new skill) | Lesson 1 |
| Lesson 2 Command | Vague initialization | `pip install specifyplus` or `uvx specifyplus init` (verified valid) | Lesson 2 |
| Lessons 4-5 Tool Usage | Terminal commands (`/sp.specify` in shell) | Claude Code commands (within IDE, orchestrated) | Lessons 4-5 |
| Lesson 7 Integration | Missing `/sp.implement` | Full AIDD cycle with `/sp.implement` | Lesson 7 |
| Mini Project 2 | Vague, incomplete | Removed; capstone in Chapter 32 | All |
| Hallucinations | Multiple incorrect workflow descriptions | All verified against actual SpecifyPlus documentation | All |
