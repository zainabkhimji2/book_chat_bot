# Implementation Tasks: Chapter 31 — Spec-Kit Plus Hands-On

**Project**: CoLearning Python Book, Part 5: Spec-Kit Plus Methodology (Chapters 30-32)
**Feature**: Chapter 31 — Spec-Kit Plus Hands-On Workflow with Human Control & Checkpoint Pattern
**Branch**: `010-chapter-31-redesign`
**Duration**: ~16-20 hours (8 lessons + validation)

---

## Overview

This document breaks down Chapter 31 implementation into atomic, independently testable tasks organized by **user story** (learning objective). Each task is small enough for one person to complete in 2-4 hours and includes explicit acceptance criteria.

**Critical Updates** (2025-11-05):
- Human Control & Checkpoint Pattern emphasis integrated throughout
- Part 5 structure corrected (Chapters 30-32, not 25-27)
- ADR governance applied (ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-003)
- Workflow isomorphism pattern (lessons mirror actual Spec-Kit Plus phases)
- CEFR proficiency scaffolding (A2→B1→B2 progression)

**Key Principles**:
- **User-Story-First Organization**: Tasks grouped by what students will learn (4 user stories from spec.md)
- **Independent Testing**: Each story's tasks can be completed and validated independently
- **Human Control Emphasis**: YOU control workflow; AI orchestrator collaborates; Spec-Kit Plus provides structure
- **Checkpoint Pattern**: Agent completes set → human reviews/commits → continues (not autonomous loops)
- **Atomic Tasks**: Small, reviewable, testable increments guided by human validation
- **Try With AI**: Every lesson ends with "Try With AI" activity (no "Key Takeaways" or "Next Steps" sections)

---

## Task Organization

- **Phase 1: Setup** (2 tasks) — Initialize branch, prepare directory structure
- **Phase 2: Foundational Documents** (6 tasks) — Chapter README, templates, references
- **Phase 3: User Story 1 — SMART Acceptance Criteria** (6 tasks) — Lesson 1 content & exercises
- **Phase 4: User Story 2 — Spec-Kit Plus Project Structure** (8 tasks) — Lessons 2-3 (Installation, Constitution, Specify)
- **Phase 5: User Story 3 — Calculator Workflow Cascade** (12 tasks) — Lessons 4-6 (Clarify, Plan, Tasks with checkpoint pattern)
- **Phase 6: User Story 4 — Implementation with Validation** (8 tasks) — Lesson 7 (Implement + Validation)
- **Phase 7: Capstone Integration** (4 tasks) — Lesson 8 (Complete workflow)
- **Phase 8: Validation & Polish** (6 tasks) — Technical review, ADR alignment, publication readiness

## Phase 8: Validation & Polish

- [ ] T045 [P] Run constitutional alignment check: Verify all lessons follow ADR-001 (workflow isomorphism), ADR-002 (CEFR proficiency scaffolding), ADR-003 (human control & checkpoint pattern). Document findings at `/specs/010-chapter-31-redesign/constitutional-alignment-report.md`

- [ ] T046 [P] Run technical review: Verify all code examples run correctly, all `/sp.*` commands are shown correctly (within AI tool context, not standalone terminal), checkpoint pattern demonstrated properly. Fix issues and document at `/specs/010-chapter-31-redesign/technical-review-report.md`

- [ ] T047 [P] Run proficiency validation: Verify CEFR levels match cognitive load (A2: max 5 concepts, B1: max 7, B1-B2: max 10), Bloom's levels align with proficiency. Document findings at `/specs/010-chapter-31-redesign/proficiency-validation-report.md`

- [ ] T048 Validate "Try With AI" sections: Confirm all 8 lessons end with "Try With AI" (NO "Key Takeaways" or "Next Steps"). Lessons 1-3 use ChatGPT web; Lessons 4-8 use Claude Code or Gemini CLI. Document compliance at `/specs/010-chapter-31-redesign/try-with-ai-compliance.md`

- [ ] T049 Create chapter completion checklist at `/specs/010-chapter-31-redesign/chapter-completion-checklist.md` confirming:
  - [ ] All 8 lessons written (01-08.md files)
  - [ ] All lessons follow ADR-001 (workflow isomorphism)
  - [ ] All lessons follow ADR-002 (CEFR proficiency)
  - [ ] All lessons follow ADR-003 (human control & checkpoint pattern)
  - [ ] All "Try With AI" sections present (no "Key Takeaways")
  - [ ] Checkpoint pattern demonstrated in Lessons 6-8
  - [ ] All code examples tested and working
  - [ ] All `/sp.*` commands shown in AI tool context (not terminal)
  - [ ] Constitutional alignment verified
  - [ ] Proficiency levels validated
  - [ ] Capstone rubric complete

- [ ] T050 Create final publication checklist at `/specs/010-chapter-31-redesign/publication-checklist.md` confirming:
  - [ ] Technical review PASSED
  - [ ] Constitutional alignment PASSED
  - [ ] Proficiency validation PASSED
  - [ ] All exercises have solutions
  - [ ] All assessments have rubrics
  - [ ] README.md accurate and complete
  - [ ] All file paths correct
  - [ ] No broken links
  - [ ] Ready for learner testing

**Gate**: All validation complete; chapter ready for publication

## Parallel Execution Strategy

**High Parallelism Opportunities**:

1. **Phase 2** (Foundational): T003-T008 all independent (6 tasks parallel)
2. **Phase 3** (US1): T010-T014 parallel after T009 (5 tasks parallel)
3. **Phase 4** (US2): T017-T022 parallel after T015-T016 (6 tasks parallel)
4. **Phase 5** (US3): T026-T034 parallel after T023-T025 (9 tasks parallel)
5. **Phase 6** (US4): T036-T040 parallel after T035 (5 tasks parallel)
6. **Phase 7** (Capstone): T042-T044 parallel after T041 (3 tasks parallel)
7. **Phase 8** (Validation): T045-T048 parallel (4 tasks parallel)

**Recommended Execution Order**:
1. Phase 1 (Setup) - 30 min
2. Phase 2 (Foundational) - 2 hours (parallelize all 6)
3. Phase 3 (US1) - 3 hours (T009 → rest parallel)
4. Phase 4 (US2) - 4 hours (T015-T016 → rest parallel)
5. Phase 5 (US3) - 6 hours (T023-T025 → rest parallel)
6. Phase 6 (US4) - 4 hours (T035 → rest parallel)
7. Phase 7 (Capstone) - 3 hours (T041 → rest parallel)
8. Phase 8 (Validation) - 2 hours (T045-T048 parallel → T049-T050)

**Total Estimated Time**: 18-22 hours

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (Minimum Viable Product)
**Deliverable**: Lessons 1-3 complete + foundation documents
- **Focus**: Installation, Constitution, Specify phases
- **Time**: 8-10 hours
- **Rationale**: Establishes foundation before tool-assisted workflow
- **Tasks**: T001-T022

### Phase 2: Tool-Assisted Workflow
**Deliverable**: Lessons 4-7 complete with checkpoint pattern
- **Focus**: Clarify, Plan, Tasks, Implement phases with human control
- **Time**: 10-12 hours
- **Prerequisite**: MVP complete
- **Tasks**: T023-T040

### Phase 3: Capstone & Validation
**Deliverable**: Lesson 8 + complete validation
- **Focus**: End-to-end integration, validation, publication readiness
- **Time**: 4-6 hours
- **Prerequisite**: Lessons 1-7 complete
- **Tasks**: T041-T050

## Policy Note for Lesson Authors

**"Try With AI" Section Requirement**:
- **REQUIRED**: Every lesson MUST end with a single final section titled "Try With AI"
- **PROHIBITED**: Do NOT include "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next" sections
- **Before AI Tools Taught** (Lessons 1-3): Use ChatGPT web in "Try With AI" section
- **After Tool Onboarding** (Lessons 4-8): Instruct learners to use preferred AI tool (Claude Code or Gemini CLI); optionally provide CLI and web variants

**Tasks updated: 2025-11-05 to incorporate ADR governance, human control emphasis, checkpoint pattern, and Part 5 chapter structure corrections (30-32).**
