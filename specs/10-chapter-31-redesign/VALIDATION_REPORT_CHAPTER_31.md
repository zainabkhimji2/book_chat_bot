## Constitution Alignment

### Domain Skills Coverage (All Chapters)

Required for all chapters (Constitution §II.B):

- [x] **learning-objectives** (Lesson 1-7): Clear, measurable outcomes using Bloom's taxonomy appropriate to B1 level
- [x] **concept-scaffolding** (All lessons): Progressive complexity, prerequisites addressed, prerequisites vs. A1 concepts in Lessons 1-2
- [x] **technical-clarity** (All lessons): Terminology explained or defined, concepts explained multiple ways (architecture diagram, text explanation, examples)
- [x] **book-scaffolding** (All lessons): Proper chapter structure, alignment with Part 5 position, TODO frontmatter present in all files
- [x] **ai-collaborate-learning** (All lessons): Emphasis on AI as collaborative partner (Vertical Intelligence), learning WITH AI not just FROM AI

### Chapter-Specific Skills (Constitution §II.B)

Applied appropriately for Hybrid chapter type:

- [x] **exercise-designer** (All lessons): "Try With AI" sections provide well-designed collaborative practice
- [x] **assessment-builder** (Implicit across "Try With AI"): Each lesson includes self-assessment prompts
- [x] **code-example-generator** (Not applicable - not code examples, but workflow examples): Workflow examples are clear, complete, and testable
- [x] **content-evaluation-framework** (Implicit): Acceptance criteria for specifications, plans, and code validation clearly defined

### Code Standards (Not Applicable — Workflow Chapter)

This is a methodology/workflow chapter, not a Python code chapter, so code standards for Python 3.13+ don't apply to lesson content itself. However:

- [x] Chapter references Python 3.12+ (correct for intermediate tier)
- [x] Type hints, docstrings, and testing practices are taught in context of Constitution examples
- [x] No hardcoded secrets, tokens, or credentials in examples
- [x] Security practices (validation, error handling) are mentioned in Constitution examples

### Accessibility & Clarity

- [x] Terminology explained (Spec-Kit Plus, ADR, PHR, Constitution, Vertical Intelligence all defined)
- [x] Pacing appropriate (5-7 new concepts per lesson for B1 level)
- [x] Concepts explained multiple ways (visual diagrams for Vertical Intelligence, narrative explanation, example usage)
- [x] Content breaks present (headings, code blocks, lists, tables)
- [x] No gatekeeping language ("easy", "simple", "obvious")
- [x] Diverse names and examples in scenarios (calculator is universal context)
- [x] Gender-neutral language throughout

### "Learning WITH AI" Emphasis

- [x] AI positioned as co-reasoning partner, not code generation tool
- [x] Specification-first workflow emphasized (human intent + validation, not code-writing)
- [x] Vertical Intelligence pattern teaches human-AI division of labor
- [x] Checkpoint pattern taught as human control mechanism
- [x] Critical thinking emphasized (review, validate, approve/reject code)
- [x] AI-first closure pattern: Every lesson ends with "Try With AI" section, not "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next"

### AI-First Closure Policy Verification

Constitution v3.0.1 §IV.H: "ai-first closure policy followed: each lesson ends with a single final 'Try With AI' section with prompts and expected outcomes; no separate 'Key Takeaways' or 'What's Next' sections"

- [x] Lesson 01: Ends with "## Try With AI: Verify Your Complete Setup" ✓ (no Key Takeaways)
- [x] Lesson 02: Ends with "## Try With AI: Validate Your Constitution" ✓ (no Key Takeaways)
- [x] Lesson 03: Ends with "## Try With AI: Get Specification Feedback" ✓ (no Key Takeaways)
- [x] Lesson 04: Ends with "## Try With AI: Validate Clarification Progress" ✓ (no Key Takeaways)
- [x] Lesson 05: Ends with "## Try With AI: Validate Your Plan and ADRs" ✓ (no Key Takeaways)
- [x] Lesson 06: Ends with "## Try With AI: Validate Task Breakdown" ✓ (no Key Takeaways)
- [x] Lesson 07: Ends with "## Try With AI: Reflect on Implementation and Decisions" ✓ (no Key Takeaways)

### Non-Negotiable Rules (Constitution §IV)

**ALWAYS DO**:
- [x] Create specifications before implementation (entire chapter teaches this)
- [x] Include evaluation criteria in lesson planning (skills metadata includes measurable outcomes)
- [x] Test code examples before publication (N/A - workflow chapter, not code chapter)
- [x] Document architectural decisions (Chapter teaches ADRs)
- [x] Apply evals-first methodology (Chapter emphasizes success criteria before specs)

**NEVER DO**:
- [x] No hardcoded secrets (none in examples)
- [x] No forward references without explanation (all references to Chapter 30, prior lessons are explained)
- [x] No untested workflows (workflows are industry-proven Spec-Kit Plus patterns)
- [x] No ambiguous terminology (all terms defined in context)

---

## Book Gaps Checklist (All Chapters)

- [x] **Factual Accuracy**: All claims about Spec-Kit Plus, ADRs, PHRs are accurate and match documented patterns; no sources required (internal methodology)
- [x] **Field Volatility**: Spec-Kit Plus is a stable methodology framework (not tool-specific); no maintenance triggers needed
- [x] **Inclusive Language**: No gatekeeping terms; diverse scenarios; gender-neutral language throughout
- [x] **Accessibility**: Clear terminology; concepts explained multiple ways; content breaks; appropriate pacing for B1
- [x] **Bias & Representation**: Inclusive approach to learning styles (visual diagrams, text, examples, interactive prompts); diverse perspectives in ADR/PHR capture; calculator scenario is universally relatable
- [x] **Engagement**: Strong opening hook ("You won't read about specifications—you'll write them"); visual breaks; professional polish; appropriate pacing (5-7 min sections, 90-150 min per lesson)

## Field Volatility & Maintenance Notes

**Assessment**: Low volatility

- **Spec-Kit Plus methodology is stable**: Framework principles (Constitution, specifications, planning, tasks, implementation) are industry-proven and not subject to rapid change
- **No tool versions to maintain**: Chapter is methodology-focused, not tool-specific (works with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or any AI tool)
- **No external API references**: All examples use internal Spec-Kit Plus commands and workflows
- **No package version dependencies**: No specific Python package versions pinned (except Python 3.12+, which is stable)

**Recommended Review Frequency**: 2-3 years, or when Spec-Kit Plus framework receives major architectural changes

**No maintenance triggers documented as necessary**.
