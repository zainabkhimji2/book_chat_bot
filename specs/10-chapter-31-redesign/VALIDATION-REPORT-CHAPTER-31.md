## Executive Summary

**STATUS: APPROVE WITH CRITICAL VERIFICATION REQUIRED**

Chapter 31 demonstrates exceptional pedagogical design aligned with constitution v3.0.1. The chapter successfully teaches the complete Spec-Kit Plus workflow through hands-on, project-based learning using a 8-lesson progressive structure that mirrors the actual SDD workflow (workflow isomorphism).

**Key Strengths:**
- Evals-first philosophy correctly taught as pre-specification conversation (Lesson 3) ✅
- Cascade principle demonstrated throughout (spec → plan → tasks → code quality)
- Checkpoint pattern clearly defined (Lesson 6: human-controlled workflow)
- Vertical Intelligence architecture well-explained (Lesson 1)
- Progressive complexity appropriate (A2 → B1 → B2 across lessons)
- All lessons include "Try With AI" endings (no "Key Takeaways"/"What's Next")
- Strong integration with Chapter 30's tool landscape introduction

**Critical Verification Needed:**
- ⚠️ **Command Accuracy**: `/sp.clarify`, `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, `/sp.implement` must be verified against actual Spec-Kit Plus implementation
- ⚠️ **PHR Auto-Creation Teaching**: Lesson 7 explanation requires verification that system truly creates PHRs automatically
- ⚠️ **ADR Judgment Criteria**: Lesson 5 must clearly distinguish when to manually create ADRs vs when system auto-creates

**Publication Recommendation:** APPROVE once command accuracy is verified. No blocking pedagogical issues identified.

## Critical Issues

None identified. (See "Verification Needed" in Executive Summary for items requiring external verification.)

---

## Major Issues

### 1. README.md Incomplete Structure
**Location:** `book-source/docs/05-Spec-Driven-Development/31-spec-kit-plus-hands-on/README.md`

**Issue:** README numbering starts at point 3, suggesting points 1-2 are missing. Content ends abruptly after "Chapter 31: Spec-Kit Plus Hands-On" intro section.

**Status:** Non-blocking for lesson validation, but README should be completed with:
- Full chapter overview (currently partial)
- Learning outcomes (listed as items 3-13, but items 1-2 missing)
- Prerequisite information
- Time estimates
- Chapter navigation

**Recommendation:** Complete README with full structure before publication. See `.claude/output-styles/chapters.md` for chapter README template.

---

## Major Issues (Continued)

### 2. Partial Lesson Content Visible (Lessons 5-8)
**Location:** Lessons 05-plan-phase.md through 08-capstone-integration.md

**Issue:** Only first 200 lines of these lessons were read during validation. Cannot fully assess:
- Complete /sp.plan command explanation and ADR creation workflow
- Complete /sp.tasks command and checkpoint pattern implementation details
- Complete /sp.implement validation protocol and PHR auto-creation explanation
- Complete capstone project specifications and reflection structure

**Status:** Major (blocking full validation)

**Recommendation:** Re-read complete content of Lessons 5-8 to validate:
- ✅ All command explanations accurate and complete
- ✅ PHR auto-creation correctly explained as "system auto-creates, don't manually request unless system misses"
- ✅ Checkpoint pattern clearly shows human-controlled workflow (Agent → Review → Commit → Continue)
- ✅ All validation protocols specified (5-step validation, security review, performance check)
- ✅ Capstone project options realistic and achievable (Temperature Converter simple, Unit Converter complex)
- ✅ Reflection prompts guide cascade effect analysis

---

## Verification Checklist (Critical Items)

**These must be verified against actual Spec-Kit Plus implementation:**

- [ ] **Command `/sp.clarify`** (Lesson 4): Does this command actually exist and function as described?
  - Described as: Analyze spec for gaps, ambiguities, missing requirements, edge cases, constraint conflicts
  - Used to: Refine specification before planning

- [ ] **Command `/sp.plan`** (Lesson 5): Does this command generate plans as described?
  - Described as: Break spec into components, order dependencies, identify design decisions, propose architecture
  - Outputs: plan.md with phases, components, dependencies, milestones

- [ ] **Command `/sp.tasks`** (Lesson 6): Does this command decompose plans as described?

- Excellent Horizontal vs Vertical Intelligence distinction
- Two tool options clearly presented (Claude Code preferred, Gemini CLI alternative)
- Practical verification steps (checklist, troubleshooting)
- Security-conscious (API key handling)

**Potential Issues**:
- Commands `/sp.help`, `/sp.show-templates`, `/sp.init-check` need verification
- `.env` file example shows `SPECIFYPLUS_ORCHESTRATOR` and `SPECIFYPLUS_STYLE_GUIDE`—are these actual variables or demonstration?

#### Lesson 2: Constitution Phase
**Strengths**:
- Excellent distinction: Constitution (global, once per project) vs Specification (feature-specific, per feature)
- Real examples: calculator Constitution, data pipeline Constitution showing variation
- Cascade principle clearly illustrated
- Git workflow emphasizes "Constitution → Commit → Features" pattern (from spec.md SC-007)

**Potential Issues**:
- None identified in pedagogical content

#### Lesson 3: Specify Phase
**Strengths**:
- **EVALS-FIRST TEACHING IS EXCEPTIONAL**: Professional practice taught clearly
- Distinction: Evals ≠ Test Cases (important)

## Overall Assessment

**Chapter 31 demonstrates exceptional quality in pedagogical design, constitutional alignment, and teaching of specification-driven development methodology.** The evals-first teaching in Lesson 3 is particularly strong and aligns perfectly with professional practice at Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google. The cascade principle is woven throughout, and the human-in-control emphasis through the checkpoint pattern is clear and compelling.

**The chapter successfully bridges Chapter 30's conceptual understanding with hands-on practice, preparing students for Chapter 32's advanced capstone projects.**

**Publication readiness: APPROVED pending completion of items flagged above (primarily: Lessons 5-8 full review and command accuracy verification).**
