3. **Feedback Method**: "Use the feedback form after each lesson (provided below)"
4. **Time Tracking**: "Track how long each lesson actually takes you"
5. **Think-Aloud**: "If possible, narrate your thoughts as you work through exercises"

**Provide to Student**:
- Link to Chapter 31: `book-source/docs/05-Spec-Driven-Development/31-spec-kit-plus-hands-on/`
- Feedback form (see template below)
- Your contact info for questions

| 8: Capstone Integration | 3-4 hrs | _____ hrs | After completion |

**Observer Notes** (if doing live observation):
- Where does student pause or re-read?
- Which commands cause confusion?
- Where does student need to look up external resources?
- When does student express frustration or satisfaction?

---

### **Phase 3: Post-Test Debrief** (45 minutes)

**Questions to Ask Student**:

1. **Overall Experience**:
   - On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate this chapter?
   - What was the most valuable thing you learned?
   - What was the most frustrating part?

2. **Clarity**:
   - Which instructions were unclear or ambiguous?
   - Which concepts were confusing?
   - Where did you need to re-read multiple times?

3. **Pacing**:
   - Which lessons felt too fast? Too slow? Just right?
   - Did the difficulty progression feel natural?
   - Were time estimates accurate?

4. **Exercises**:
   - Which "Try With AI" activities were most helpful?
   - Which exercises felt too easy? Too hard?
   - Did you complete all exercises or skip any?

5. **Technical Accuracy**:
   - Did all commands work as described?
   - Did you encounter any errors not mentioned in the chapter?
   - Were any examples outdated or incorrect?

6. **Outcomes**:
   - Can you now build a project using Spec-Kit Plus independently?
   - Do you feel confident using the 7 core commands?
   - Would you recommend this chapter to others?

## Critical Success Criteria

### **Must Be True for Publication**:

1. **Technical Accuracy**: ☐ All commands work as described (100% success rate)
2. **Time Estimates**: ☐ Actual time within ±30% of estimated (e.g., 1.5hr lesson = 1-2 hrs actual)
3. **Clarity**: ☐ Average clarity rating ≥4.0/5.0 across all lessons
4. **Completion Rate**: ☐ Student completes all 8 lessons without giving up
5. **Comprehension**: ☐ Student can complete capstone (Lesson 8) independently
6. **Recommendation**: ☐ Student would recommend chapter to peers

### **Nice to Have**:

- ☐ Student expresses excitement about spec-first development
- ☐ Student reports "aha moments" about evals-first or human control
- ☐ Student plans to use Spec-Kit Plus in future projects
- ☐ Time estimates are accurate within ±20%

---

## Common Issues to Watch For

### **Installation Problems** (Lesson 1):
- API key configuration errors
- Python version mismatches
- Directory permission issues
- Command not found errors

**Mitigation**: Have troubleshooting section ready with common fixes

### **Conceptual Confusion** (Lessons 2-4):
- "What's the difference between Constitution and Spec?"
- "When do I use /sp.clarify vs just editing the spec?"
- "What are evals exactly?"

**Mitigation**: Ensure definitions are clear and examples concrete

### **Command Errors** (Lessons 5-7):
- Commands not recognized by AI tool
- Unexpected command outputs
- PHRs not auto-created as described

**Mitigation**: Verify all commands against actual Spec-Kit Plus implementation

### **Time Pressure** (Lesson 8):
- Capstone takes longer than 3-4 hours
- Student feels overwhelmed by independent work
- Student skips optional complexity

**Mitigation**: Clarify that 3-4 hours is minimum; 5-6 hours is normal for thorough work

---

## Data Collection Checklist

**For Each Test Session, Collect**:
- ☐ Completed feedback forms (8 total, one per lesson)
- ☐ Actual time tracking data
- ☐ Screenshots of any errors encountered
- ☐ Student's final capstone project artifacts
- ☐ Post-test debrief notes
- ☐ Any communication/questions during the test

---

## Analysis & Iteration

**After Testing, Review**:

1. **Aggregate Time Data**:
   - Calculate average actual time per lesson
   - Identify lessons that consistently run over
   - Update time estimates if >30% variance

2. **Identify Clarity Issues**:
   - List all sections rated <4.0 for clarity
   - Prioritize fixes for critical path content
   - Rewrite ambiguous instructions

3. **Fix Technical Errors**:
   - Document any command failures
   - Verify against Spec-Kit Plus source
   - Update lesson content or command references

4. **Assess Difficulty Progression**:
   - Check if A2→B1→B2 progression feels natural
   - Verify cognitive load (5/7/10 concepts) is appropriate
   - Adjust complexity if students struggle or get bored

5. **Incorporate Feedback**:
   - Create GitHub issues for major improvements
   - Make minor fixes immediately
   - Document any deferred improvements
