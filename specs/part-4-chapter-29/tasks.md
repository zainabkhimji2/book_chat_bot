- [ ] T076 Integrate 3 💬 AI Colearning Prompts:
  - Prompt 1: When introducing project ("Help me design the architecture for a multi-agent system. What classes do I need? What methods? How should agents communicate?")
  - Prompt 2: During implementation ("I want to add 2 more agent types: sentiment analysis + keyword extraction. Generate code and explain integration.")
  - Prompt 3: After testing ("My agents aren't running in parallel. Here's the code [paste]. What's wrong? How do I verify free-threading is active?")

- [ ] T077 [P] Integrate 2 🎓 Instructor Commentaries:
  - Commentary 1: After foundation code ("Professional AI developers describe architecture, AI generates scaffolding, then they validate and extend. This is AI-native workflow.")
  - Commentary 2: After production context ("Free-threading isn't just academic—it's how you'll build production systems in Parts 11-14")

- [ ] T078 [P] Integrate 2 🚀 CoLearning Challenges:
  - Challenge 1: During implementation ("Add benchmarking: compare threading vs multiprocessing vs free-threaded for your agent workload")
  - Challenge 2: Before Try With AI ("Ask AI to suggest 3 real-world AI applications where this multi-agent pattern would excel")

- [ ] T079 [P] Integrate 1 ✨ Teaching Tip:
  - Tip 1: When debugging ("Use your AI to debug thread issues: 'My agents share a dict. Is this thread-safe in free-threaded Python? Should I add locks?'")

### Lesson Closure Task

- [ ] T080 Write "Try With AI" section (4 prompts):
  - Prompt 1 (Remember): "Summarize what you learned in Lessons 1-5. Then ask your AI: 'What are the 3 most important concepts for building this capstone project?'"
  - Prompt 2 (Understand): "Ask your AI: 'Explain step-by-step how the multi-agent system achieves true parallelism. What would break if I used traditional threading?'"
  - Prompt 3 (Apply): "Tell your AI: 'Help me implement the benchmarking dashboard. I want to compare 4 concurrency approaches with ASCII bar charts. Generate the code.'"
  - Prompt 4 (Analyze/Synthesize): "Ask your AI: 'How would I deploy this multi-agent system in Kubernetes (Part 11)? What changes for production? How does free-threading help with resource utilization?'"

**Acceptance Criteria (Lesson 6)**:
- ✅ 8 concepts covered (B2 synthesis allows integration of prior knowledge)
- ✅ Reading level: B1-B2
- ✅ All CoLearning elements present
- ✅ Code Example 8 tested and working (capstone foundation)
- ✅ Capstone project is DOABLE in 2-3 hours (scaffolding provided)
- ✅ Production context integrated (Parts 11-14 preview)
- ✅ Lesson ends with "Try With AI" ONLY

## Phase 8: Final Validation & Quality Assurance

### Validation Tasks

- [ ] T081 [P] Run reading level analysis on all 6 lessons (verify Flesch-Kincaid Grade 9-11 for B1-B2)
- [ ] T082 [P] Test all 8 code examples on Python 3.14.0+ (verify working, no errors)
- [ ] T083 [P] Validate CoLearning element count (50+ prompts total across 6 lessons: ✅ 💬🎓🚀✨)
- [ ] T084 Verify lesson closure compliance (all 6 lessons end with "Try With AI" ONLY, no summaries after)
- [ ] T085 Check proficiency progression (validate B1 → B1-B2 → B2, no zigzag)
- [ ] T086 Validate no forward references (Lesson N only uses concepts from Lessons 1 to N-1)

**Acceptance Criteria (Final Validation)**:
- ✅ All code examples run on Python 3.14.0+
- ✅ Reading level: B1-B2 (all lessons)
- ✅ 50+ CoLearning prompts present
- ✅ All lessons end with "Try With AI" ONLY
- ✅ Proficiency progression smooth (no zigzag)
- ✅ No forward references within chapter
- ✅ All 11 success evals supported by lessons

## Implementation Notes

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Within Each Lesson**:
- Code examples can be written concurrently (marked with [P])
- CoLearning element integration can be parallelized (💬🎓🚀✨ tasks)
- Content sections are sequential (dependencies exist)

**Example** (Lesson 4):
- T048 (Example 2) + T049 (Example 6) can be written in parallel
- T050-T053 (CoLearning elements) can be written in parallel
- T040-T047 (content sections) must be sequential

### MVP Scope Recommendation

**Minimum Viable Chapter** (Lessons 1-4):
- Lesson 1: CPython fundamentals
- Lesson 2: Python 3.14 improvements
- Lesson 3: Traditional GIL understanding
- Lesson 4: Free-threaded Python (PRIMARY)

**Rationale**: Lessons 1-4 provide complete understanding of CPython + GIL evolution + free-threading. Students can stop here and still have foundational knowledge. Lessons 5-6 add practical application but aren't required for conceptual understanding.

**Full Chapter** (Lessons 1-6):
- Add Lesson 5: Concurrency decision-making (practical)
- Add Lesson 6: Capstone project (integration)

**Rationale**: Lessons 5-6 transform understanding into application. Students learn to CHOOSE and BUILD, not just understand. Essential for production readiness.

### Policy Note for Lesson Authors

**"Try With AI" Section Context**:
- **Before Part 1 (AI tools not yet taught)**: Use ChatGPT web interface in "Try With AI" prompts
- **After Part 1 (Claude Code/Gemini CLI taught)**: Instruct students to "Use your AI companion (Claude Code or Gemini CLI)" with optional web alternative
- **Chapter 29 (Part 4, after tools taught)**: ALL prompts assume students have Claude Code or Gemini CLI available
- **Format**: Always end with "Try With AI" section ONLY (no "Key Takeaways", "Summary", or "What's Next" after)

### Constitutional Compliance

**All tasks respect**:
- ✅ AI-Native Learning pattern (describe intent → explore → validate → learn from errors)
- ✅ Graduated Teaching Pattern (Book teaches foundational, AI handles complex, AI orchestrates scale)
- ✅ Cognitive Load Limits (B1: max 10 concepts)
- ✅ CoLearning Pedagogy (💬🎓🚀✨ throughout, not just at end)
- ✅ Lesson Closure Rule (Try With AI ONLY)
- ✅ No Forward References (Part 4 language, no SDD terminology)
- ✅ Python 3.14+ (modern type hints, free-threading production-ready)
