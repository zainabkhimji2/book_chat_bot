## Risk Management & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Code examples fail on Python 3.14+** | High - Blocks publication | Test all examples on 3.14+; cross-platform (Mac/Linux/Windows); use mypy for type checking |
| **Cognitive load exceeds 5 concepts per lesson** | High - Violates spec | Count concepts explicitly; group related items; defer advanced to future chapters |
| **"Try With AI" prompts are vague** | Medium - Students confused | Make prompts concrete; include expected outcomes; reference specific concepts |
| **Forward references to Chapter 17+** | High - Violates scope | Audit all examples; search for: loops, functions, classes, collections, try/except |
| **CoLearning elements missing or weak** | Medium - Misses pedagogy | Include 💬🎓🚀✨ markers; test that students can engage with each element |
| **Reading level exceeds Grade 8** | Medium - Accessibility issue | Use Flesch-Kincaid checker; keep sentences short; define jargon |
| **Capstone introduces new concepts** | High - Violates design | Capstone uses ONLY Lessons 1–4 skills; verify no new methods, types, or patterns |
| **Lessons too long** | Medium - Cognitive overload | Target 48–54 min per lesson; review pacing; break long sections |
| **Integration between lessons unclear** | Low-Medium | Show how each lesson builds on prior; use explicit prerequisites |

---

## Follow-Ups & Next Steps

**Immediately After Chapter 16 Completes**:

1. **Deploy to Docusaurus**: Push to main branch; trigger production build
2. **Update Chapter Index**: Mark Chapter 16 as COMPLETE in `specs/book/chapter-index.md`
3. **Validate Skills Registry**: Update `specs/part-4-skills-registry.md` with Ch 16 skills and proficiency levels
4. **Prepare Chapter 17 Specs**: Begin planning Chapter 17 (Control Flow) which depends on Ch 16 type knowledge

**Longer-Term**:

1. **Monitor Learner Performance**: Track EVAL achievement (80%+ for EVAL-001, 75%+ for EVAL-002, etc.)
2. **Gather Feedback**: Collect student comments on difficulty, clarity, engagement
3. **Maintain & Update**: Keep examples current with Python 3.15+ as it releases
4. **Extend Skills Registry**: Link Chapter 16 skills to future chapters that build on them
