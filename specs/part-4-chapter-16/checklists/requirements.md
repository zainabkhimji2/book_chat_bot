# Specification Quality Checklist: Strings and Type Casting

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs (student learning outcomes)
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (clear, accessible language)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Educational Content Specific Checks

- [x] Learning objectives aligned with success evals
- [x] Prerequisites explicitly listed (Chapters 1-15)
- [x] CEFR proficiency levels appropriate (A1-A2 for beginner tier)
- [x] Cognitive load within limits (max 5 concepts per lesson)
- [x] No forward references to untaught concepts (Chapters 17+)
- [x] AI-Native Learning pattern integrated throughout
- [x] Lesson closure pattern specified (Try With AI ONLY)
- [x] Complexity tier matches chapter number range (12-16 = beginner)

## Notes

**Validation Results**: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED

- Spec is complete and ready for `/sp.plan`
- No clarifications needed—user provided clear scope answers (Q1-Q3)
- Success evals defined FIRST before topic summary (professional AI-native pattern)
- All requirements testable and measurable
- Scope ruthlessly filtered (only strings + type casting, no collections/regex/advanced)
- Part 4 appropriate language used (describe intent, NOT write specifications)
- Constitutional alignment verified (AI-Native Learning, graduated teaching, lesson closure)

**Key Strengths**:

1. Success Evals defined first with business-goal connection (comprehension, skill acquisition, engagement, accessibility)
2. User stories prioritized and independently testable
3. Cognitive load managed (max 5 concepts per lesson)
4. Scope boundaries explicit (in-scope vs out-of-scope clearly marked)
5. AI-Native Learning pattern embedded throughout (💬🎓🚀✨ elements specified)
6. No implementation details (Python syntax shown only as examples, not requirements)

**Ready for Next Phase**: Specification is production-ready for `/sp.plan`
