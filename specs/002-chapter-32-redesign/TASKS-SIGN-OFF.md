### ✅ Section 4: Vision Centrality (7-9 agent Focus)

**The "1 Human + 7-9 AI Agents" vision is central throughout the document**:

- **Total "7-9 agent" mentions**: 81 occurrences
- **Required frequency**: 3-8 mentions per lesson
- **Actual frequency**: Exceeds requirements significantly

**Key Vision Elements**:
- [x] North Star Vision section (lines 15-63)
- [x] Student Journey shows progression to 7-9 agents
- [x] Every lesson task has Scale Connection validation
- [x] Lesson 8 positioned as THE CLIMAX (not optional)

- [x] Chapter README leads with vision
- [x] Capstone portfolio narrative emphasizes capability

**Evidence**:
- 81 mentions of "7-9 agent" throughout document
- Lesson 8 marked: "Priority: MUST (THIS IS THE PAYOFF)"
- Lesson 8 note: "THIS IS THE CLIMAX - where students SEE the 7-9 agent vision realized. Not optional - this is where everything clicks."

---

### ✅ Section 5: Lesson 8 Elevation (CLIMAX Status)

**Lesson 8 successfully transformed from "optional advanced" to "THE CLIMAX"**:

**Before** (user correction):
- Priority: SHOULD
- Framing: "Optional lesson"
- Position: Advanced bonus content

**After** (corrected):
- Priority: MUST (THIS IS THE PAYOFF)
- Framing: "THE CLIMAX - Vision Realization"
- Position: Central payoff where everything clicks
- Phase name: "Phase 4: THE CLIMAX — Vision Realization (Lesson 8)"
- Opening hook: "This is it. Everything you've learned builds to this moment..."
- Content includes: Student RUNS 5-agent orchestration script and SEES it work
- Explicit section: "The Path to 7-9 agents"
- Climax messaging: "You just witnessed the vision. 1 script orchestrated 5 agents."

**Evidence**: Verified at lines 950-969 (Task 4.1 structure)

---

### ✅ Section 6: Self-Contained Task Execution

**All tasks are self-contained and executable without conversation context**:

Each task includes:
1. **What to read**: Style guides, lesson plans, external docs, example lessons, conceptual resources
2. **How to do it**: Complete code templates, Try With AI prompts (3 per lesson), worksheets, real-world examples
3. **How to validate**: Quality standards, cognitive load limits, CEFR proficiency levels, reading level
4. **Testable acceptance**: 4-6 specific checklist items per task
5. **Scale connection**: 5 checkboxes ensuring 7-9 agent vision is central

**Example (Task 2.2 - Lesson 2)**:
- Technical References: 7 categories (lesson style guide, plan section, git worktree docs, session management articles, Claude Code docs, planning frameworks, example lessons)
- Implementation Guidance: Complete tmux script (18 lines), plan quality rubric table, 3 Try With AI prompts
- Quality Standards: Code execution requirements, cognitive load limit (7 concepts), CEFR level (A2), scale mentions (3+)
- Validation Checklist: 6 testable items
- Scale Connection: 5 checkboxes

**Evidence**: All lesson tasks (2.1-2.4, 3.1-3.3, 4.1, 5.1) verified to have complete sections

---

### ✅ Section 7: 60/40 Thinking-to-Tooling Ratio

**Decomposition thinking emphasized over tool proficiency**:

- Primary learning objective: Decomposition thinking (breaking systems into parallelizable units)
- Secondary learning objective: Tool proficiency (git worktrees, Claude Code, SpecKit Plus)
- Every lesson answers: "Why does this matter for coordinating 7-9 agents?"
- Tools framed as "vehicles for experiencing decomposition patterns"
- Success criteria measure capability, not tool knowledge
- Portfolio narrative emphasizes transferable skill

**Evidence**:
- Spec.md success criteria split: 60% thinking (SC-001 to SC-005), 40% tooling (SC-006 to SC-009)
- Task 2.4 (Lesson 4) includes explicit transferability section showing decomposition thinking applies to: AI agents → junior developers → distributed teams → organizational scaling
- Portfolio narrative script (Task 5.1): "BAD: I used git worktrees" vs "GOOD: I demonstrated decomposition thinking"

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Proceed to implementation**: Run `/sp.implement` to begin executing tasks
2. **Start with Phase 1**: Task 1.1 (Chapter README) is first task
3. **Track progress**: Use PHR (Prompt History Records) to document each implementation session
4. **Validate iteratively**: Use technical-reviewer subagent after completing each lesson

### Implementation Workflow

**For Each Lesson**:
1. Read task technical references (style guides, lesson plan, example lessons)
2. Follow implementation guidance (code templates, Try With AI prompts)
3. Apply quality standards (cognitive load limits, CEFR proficiency, scale connection)
4. Execute validation checklist (testable acceptance criteria)
5. Create PHR documenting implementation session
6. Review with human before proceeding to next lesson

**Critical Success Factors**:
- Maintain 7-9 agent vision centrality (check Scale Connection validation)
- Keep 60/40 thinking-to-tooling ratio (decomposition thinking primary)
- Ensure all code examples are copy-paste ready and tested
- Verify Try With AI prompts generate helpful responses
- Apply appropriate CEFR proficiency level (A2/B1/B2)

### Monitoring Progress

**Checkpoints**:
- After Phase 2 (Foundation Lessons 1-4): Review consistency and flow
- After Phase 4 (THE CLIMAX - Lesson 8): Verify vision realization is powerful
- After Phase 5 (Capstone - Lesson 9): Ensure students can demonstrate capability
- After Phase 10 (Review & Polish): Prepare for technical-reviewer validation
