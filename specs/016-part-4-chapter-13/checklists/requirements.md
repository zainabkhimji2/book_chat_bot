# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 13 - Introduction to Python

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-08
**Feature**: [Chapter 13 Specification](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - ✅ PASS: Spec focuses on learning outcomes, not implementation
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - ✅ PASS: All evals connect to student success (comprehension, skill acquisition, engagement)
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - ✅ PASS: Accessible language, education-focused (students, educators, reviewers)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - ✅ PASS: All template sections present (Success Evals, User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - ✅ PASS: Zero clarification markers in spec
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - ✅ PASS: All FRs include "MUST" statements with clear criteria
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - ✅ PASS: All SCs include percentages, time limits, or binary pass/fail (e.g., "75% of students", "Grade 7-8 reading level")
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - ✅ PASS: SCs focus on learning outcomes, not Python-specific metrics (e.g., "can explain Python" not "can write Python classes")
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - ✅ PASS: Each user story includes Given/When/Then scenarios
- [x] Edge cases are identified - ✅ PASS: Edge Cases section covers installation errors, wrong versions, type mismatches, syntax errors
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - ✅ PASS: Explicit EXCLUDE list (no OOP, control flow, functions, collections)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - ✅ PASS: Prerequisites section + Assumptions section document all dependencies

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - ✅ PASS: FR-001 through FR-024 each include specific, testable criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - ✅ PASS: 5 user stories cover full learning journey (understand → install → code → run → build)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - ✅ PASS: 13 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-013) align with 5 learning objectives and 11 evals
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - ✅ PASS: No mention of lesson-writer agents, technical-reviewer, or implementation workflow

## Evals-First Validation (Constitutional Requirement)

- [x] Success Evals section appears FIRST (before User Scenarios) - ✅ PASS: Evals are Section 1 (after header)
- [x] Evals connect to business outcomes (student success, not arbitrary metrics) - ✅ PASS: All evals measure comprehension, skill acquisition, or engagement (not "code runs fast")
- [x] Evals vary by context appropriately - ✅ PASS: Mix of comprehension evals (quiz), skill evals (capstone completion), engagement evals (submission tracking), accessibility evals (reading level)
- [x] User Stories reference evals - ✅ PASS: Each user story connects to specific evals via Learning Objectives
- [x] Success Criteria reference evals - ✅ PASS: SCs map to evals (e.g., SC-001 maps to EVAL-001, SC-002 maps to EVAL-004)

## AI-Native Learning Compliance (Part 4 Specific)

- [x] Uses "describe intent" framing (NOT "write specifications") - ✅ PASS: Type hints described as "describing intent", zero SDD terminology
- [x] AI positioned as co-reasoning partner - ✅ PASS: Throughout spec (e.g., "explore concepts with AI companion", "validate with AI")
- [x] References AIDD principles from Chapters 1-11 for context - ✅ PASS: Topic Summary connects Python to AIDD methodology
- [x] No formal SDD terminology - ✅ PASS: Zero mentions of "specification-driven development" (that's Part 5)
- [x] Appropriate for Part 4 (Python Fundamentals) - ✅ PASS: Beginner tier, foundational concepts, prepares for Chapter 14

## Cognitive Load Compliance (Beginner Tier)

- [x] Maximum 5 concepts per lesson specified - ✅ PASS: Each lesson outline lists ≤ 5 concepts (FR-002, Content Outline)
- [x] Maximum 2 options to choose from - ✅ PASS: Spec doesn't offer choices (no "Option A vs B" decisions for students)
- [x] Simple, clear framing - ✅ PASS: "Your AI handles complexity" language, beginner-friendly descriptions
- [x] One new skill per lesson (where possible) - ✅ PASS: Lesson 1 (understanding), Lesson 2 (installation), Lesson 3 (variables), Lesson 4 (syntax), Lesson 5 (integration)

## No Forward References (Critical for Chapter 13)

- [x] Zero mentions of OOP (classes, objects, methods) - ✅ PASS: Verified via search - no OOP terms
- [x] Zero mentions of duck typing - ✅ PASS: No duck typing references
- [x] Zero mentions of control flow (if/else, loops) - ✅ PASS: No control flow in spec
- [x] Zero mentions of functions (def, parameters, return) - ✅ PASS: Only `print()` and `input()` built-ins (not custom functions)
- [x] Zero mentions of collections (lists, dicts, tuples) - ✅ PASS: Only core types (int, str, float, bool)
- [x] Zero mentions of exception handling - ✅ PASS: Error handling via AI assistance, not try/except

## Lesson Closure Pattern (Constitutional Rule 8)

- [x] Spec requires "Try With AI" as ONLY closure - ✅ PASS: FR-003 explicitly states "no summaries, checklists, or other closure content"
- [x] Exactly 4 prompts required per lesson - ✅ PASS: FR-003 specifies "exactly 4 prompts"
- [x] Progressive Bloom's levels specified - ✅ PASS: Content Outline mentions "Remember → Understand → Apply → Analyze" progression

## CoLearning Pedagogy (Constitutional Rule 9)

- [x] CoLearning elements required throughout (not just end) - ✅ PASS: FR-014 requires 💬🎓🚀✨ throughout
- [x] Conversational tone specified - ✅ PASS: FR-015 requires "you, your, we" tone
- [x] "Syntax cheap, semantics gold" mantra - ✅ PASS: FR-017 requires this philosophy
- [x] AI companion positioned as co-teacher - ✅ PASS: Multiple references to AI as co-reasoning partner

## Type Hints Positioning

- [x] Type hints as CORE concept (not optional/advanced) - ✅ PASS: FR-016, LO-003, multiple emphasis points
- [x] Type hints connected to "describing intent" - ✅ PASS: Lesson 3 explicitly frames type hints as "describing intent"
- [x] Type hints mandatory in all code examples - ✅ PASS: FR-011 requires "zero exceptions"

## Validation Status

**Overall Status**: ✅ **SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

**Strengths**:
1. Comprehensive success evals (11 evals covering all aspects)
2. Clear scope boundaries (explicit EXCLUDE list)
3. Strong pedagogical structure (CoLearning, AI-Native Learning)
4. Measurable outcomes (all SCs quantified)
5. No forward references (critical for Chapter 13)

**Recommendations for Planning Phase**:
1. Ensure lesson-writer subagent applies all 11 evals during implementation
2. Map CEFR proficiency levels in plan.md (A1 → A2 → B1 progression)
3. Use skills-proficiency-mapper to validate cognitive load
4. Create task checklist that references all 24 functional requirements

**Ready for**: `/sp.plan` (no clarifications needed)
