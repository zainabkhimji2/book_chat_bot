## Implementation Notes

**For lesson-writer subagent**:
- Follow lesson outlines exactly (word counts, time budgets)
- Ground ALL claims in context document (no speculation, cite sources)
- Use Show-Then-Explain: examples first → then concepts
- Define every term on first use (heavy scaffolding)
- Use analogies naturally (Conductor, Coach, Architect — see plan.md)
- Heavy scaffolding for diverse audiences (no gatekeeping)
- Respect 15-20 minute total reading time (don't overwhelm)
- Format with Markdown: headers, bold, examples clearly distinguished
- Include YAML frontmatter with lesson metadata

**YAML Frontmatter Template**:
```yaml
---
sidebar_position: [lesson_number]
title: "[Lesson Title]"
duration: "[X-Y minutes]"
learning_objective: "[Bloom's aligned objective]"
---
```

**For human reviewer**:
- After each lesson completes: Review for clarity, accuracy, engagement, pedagogy, grounding
- Ask: "Does this hook readers and make them want the next lesson?"
- Check: All claims grounded in context document
- Verify: Word count, reading time realistic
- Assess: Domain skills visibly applied
- Approve or request revisions before proceeding to next lesson
