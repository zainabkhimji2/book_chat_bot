# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 1 - Welcome to Agent-Native Education

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [Chapter 1 Spec](../spec.md)
**Branch**: `003-chapter-1-spec`

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and reader learning outcomes
- [x] Written for readers (learners, not instructors)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
- [x] Clear purpose statement grounded in agent-native education vision

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (use of percentages and concrete outcomes)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined in user stories
- [x] Edge cases identified and addressed
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (6 sections covering specific topics)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (grounded in AI Coding Revolution Paper)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010) have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (4 user stories with P1 and P2 priorities)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (8 success criteria)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
- [x] Content structure clearly defined with word counts and purposes
- [x] Pedagogical approach aligned with Constitution principles

## Design Correctness

- [x] Agent-native education model clearly defined (co-learner, collaborator, creative partner)
- [x] Content grounded in AI Coding Revolution Paper as primary source
- [x] Addresses psychological concerns (AI anxiety, job displacement fears)
- [x] Includes concrete examples (solo builders, vertical opportunities)
- [x] Establishes foundation for Parts 2-7 progression
- [x] Defines key concepts (agent orchestrator, context engineering, etc.)

## Constitutional Alignment

- [x] **Principle 1 (AI-First Teaching)**: Chapter emphasizes AI as collaborative partner, not replacement
- [x] **Principle 8 (Inclusivity)**: Multiple entry points, accessible language, no gatekeeping
- [x] **Principle 9 (Show-then-Explain)**: Pedagogical approach explicitly outlined as Show → Explain → Practice → Assess

## Pedagogical Integrity

- [x] Clear learning outcomes for readers (in User Stories)
- [x] Scaffolding strategy defined (heavy for beginners)
- [x] Assessment methods identified (comprehension check + reflection exercise)
- [x] Multiple learning pathways documented (narrative, bullets, visuals, examples)
- [x] Emotional intelligence considerations included
- [x] Visual resources identified (3 diagrams needed)
- [x] Examples specified (solo builders, vertical specializations)
- [x] Analogies outlined (orchestrator, architect, coach, conductor)

## Specification Maturity

- [x] Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- [x] No ambiguities that would prevent lesson-writer from creating content
- [x] All sections follow template structure
- [x] Formatting is clear and scannable
- [x] Cross-references to Part 1 Spec and Constitution are accurate
- [x] Success metrics are measurable and verifiable

## Summary

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

This specification is complete, clear, and ready to be handed to the chapter-planner subagent for detailed lesson planning. All mandatory sections are completed, requirements are testable, and success criteria are measurable.

**Key Strengths**:
1. Strong grounding in AI Coding Revolution Paper (verifiable, not speculative)
2. Clear emotional/psychological dimension addressing reader concerns
3. Well-defined pedagogical approach aligned with Constitution
4. Measurable success criteria with specific percentages
5. Four distinct user stories covering full spectrum of reader needs

**Ready for Next Steps**:
- ✅ Invoke chapter-planner subagent with this spec
- ✅ Use spec to generate detailed lesson plans (chapter-01-plan.md)
- ✅ Use plan to generate implementation tasks (chapter-01-tasks.md)
