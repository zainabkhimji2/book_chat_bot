# Tasks: Chapter 6 - Gemini CLI: Installation and Basics

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-chapter-6/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md (7 user stories with priorities P1-P3)

**Organization**: Tasks organized by lesson/phase for educational content creation, with user story mappings where applicable.

**Note**: This is a book chapter, not software. Tasks focus on content creation, testing commands, and pedagogical design rather than code implementation.

## 📋 IMPORTANT UPDATE: Lesson Consolidation (2025-10-31)

**Change**: Lessons 2, 3, and 4 have been **combined into a single streamlined lesson**: "Installation, Authentication & First Steps" (Lesson 2)

**New Chapter Structure** (4 lessons instead of 6):
1. **Lesson 1**: Why Gemini CLI Matters ✅ COMPLETE
2. **Lesson 2**: Installation, Authentication & First Steps ✅ COMPLETE (consolidates old L2, L3, L4)
3. **Lesson 3**: Built-In Tools Deep Dive (formerly Lesson 5)
4. **Lesson 4**: Context Window & Tool Comparison (formerly Lesson 6)

**Impact**:
- ✅ **Content reduction**: 28% shorter (260 vs 360 lines combined)
- ✅ **User Stories US1 & US2 fully addressed** in combined Lesson 2
- ✅ **Time savings**: ~20 hours development effort saved
- ✅ **Quality improvement**: More scannable (tables, lists), clearer progression
- ✅ **All 8 domain skills applied** in combined lesson

**Files Created**:
- `book-source/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/06-gemini-cli-installation-and-basics/02-installation-authentication-first-steps.md` ✅
- `history/prompts/001-chapter-6/01-combined-installation-auth-lesson.implement.prompt.md` ✅

**Tasks Consolidated**: T008-T027 (20 tasks merged into single lesson implementation)

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different lessons, no dependencies)
- **[US#]**: Maps to user story from spec.md (US1-US7)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## User Story Mapping

| Story | Priority | Focus | Lessons |
|-------|----------|-------|---------|
| US1 | P1 | Installation & Authentication | **Lesson 2 (Combined)** |
| US2 | P1 | Basic Configuration & First Command | **Lesson 2 (Combined)** |

## Dependencies & Parallel Work

### Sequential Dependencies (UPDATED for 4-lesson structure):
1. **Phase 1** (outlines) → **Phases 2-5** (lesson writing)
2. **Phases 2-5** (content writing) → **Phase 6** (command verification)
3. **Phase 6** (verification) → **Phase 7** (exercises)
4. **Phases 1-7** complete → **Phase 8** (cross-cutting)
5. **Phase 8** complete → **Phase 9** (integration)
6. **All phases** complete → **Phase 10** (final review)

### Parallel Opportunities (UPDATED):

**Within Phase 1**: All lesson outlines can be created in parallel (now 4 lessons instead of 6)

**Within Phases 2-5**: Lessons can be written independently:
- **Lesson 1** (T028-T033) ‖ **Lesson 2 COMBINED** (T008-T027) ‖ **Lesson 3** (T034-T040) ‖ **Lesson 4** (T041-T050)

**Within Phase 6**: Platform testing can happen in parallel:
- Windows (T051) ‖ macOS (T052) ‖ Linux (T053)
- Tool testing: T055, T056, T057 can run in parallel

**Within Phase 7**: Exercise design tasks can run in parallel:
- T060 (Lesson 1) ‖ T064 (Lesson 3) ‖ T065 (Lesson 4)
- **Note**: T061-T063 already completed in combined Lesson 2

**Within Phase 8**: Cross-cutting tasks T069, T071, T072 can run in parallel

**Within Phase 9**: Integration verification T074, T075, T077 can run in parallel

---

## Task Summary (UPDATED)

- **Total Tasks**: 84 discrete, testable items (many consolidated into combined Lesson 2)

- **Parallelizable Tasks**: 45+ tasks marked with [P]
- **User Story Coverage**: All 7 user stories (US1-US7) mapped to tasks
- **Critical Path**: Outlines → Content Writing → Command Testing → Review
- **Estimated Effort**: 60-80 hours total (reduced from 80-100 due to lesson consolidation)
- **Effort Saved**: ~20 hours due to combining 3 lessons into 1
- **Bottlenecks**:
  - Phase 6 command testing (requires access to all three platforms)
  - Phase 10 technical accuracy review (requires expert validation)

**Consolidation Impact**:
- **Content reduction**: 28% shorter combined lesson (260 vs 360 lines)
- **Time savings**: Eliminated redundant explanations, duplicate examples

## Implementation Strategy (UPDATED for 4-lesson structure)

### MVP Scope (Deliver First) ✅ COMPLETED
**User Stories 1-2 (P1 priority)**:
- **Lesson 2: Installation, Authentication & First Steps** (US1 + US2 COMBINED) ✅
- Command verification for US1-US2 (ready for testing: T051-T054)

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** — Learners can install, authenticate, and execute first commands successfully. This is the minimum viable chapter.

### Second Increment ✅ COMPLETED
**User Story 6 (P2 priority)**:
- **Lesson 1: Why Gemini CLI Matters** (US6, US7) ✅
- Lesson 4: Tool Comparison sections (US6) — in progress

**Status**: ✅ **Lesson 1 COMPLETE** — Adds strategic context and decision framework for tool selection.

### Third Increment (IN PROGRESS)
**User Stories 3-4 (P2 priority)**:
- **Lesson 3: Built-In Tools Deep Dive** (US3) — formerly Lesson 5
- **Lesson 4: Context Window & Tool Comparison** (US4, US6) — formerly Lesson 6

**Status**: Content written, needs review and testing.

### Final Increment (IN PROGRESS)
**User Stories 5, 7 (P3 priority)**:
- Extensions introduction (US5) — in Lesson 4
- Qwen Code mention (US7) — in Lessons 1 and 4

**Status**: Nice-to-have context for advanced learners and ecosystem awareness.

## Follow-Ups & Risks

**Risk 1: Gemini CLI Version Changes**
- **Mitigation**: Document current version (Gemini 2.5 Pro) with update trigger note
- **Action**: Flag chapter for review if Gemini releases major version update

**Risk 2: Installation Dependency Complexity**
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive troubleshooting for Node.js, npm, permissions
- **Action**: Test installations on clean systems with various setups (T051-T053)

**Risk 3: Regional Access Restrictions**
- **Mitigation**: Acknowledge restrictions upfront; mention Qwen Code alternative (T021, T048)
- **Action**: Document regions where Gemini CLI is unavailable

**Risk 4: Learner Overwhelm from Multiple Tools**
- **Mitigation**: Moderate scaffolding; one tool at a time in Lesson 5
- **Action**: Build tool combinations gradually in T039

**Risk 5: Inconsistent Command Output**
- **Mitigation**: Emphasize that Gemini's responses vary; show typical responses
- **Action**: Include multiple example outputs in T024, T054

---

## Next Steps After Task Completion

1. **Technical Review**: Invoke technical-reviewer subagent to validate technical accuracy
2. **Pedagogical Review**: Verify Bloom's progression and learning outcomes met
3. **Integration Verification**: Check flow with Chapters 5, 7, 8
4. **Docusaurus Publication**: Build and publish to book website
5. **Beta Testing**: Gather learner feedback on clarity and exercises
6. **Refinement**: Address feedback and publish final version
