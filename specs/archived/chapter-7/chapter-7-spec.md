# Chapter 7 Specification: Understanding Your AI Companion's Bash Usage

**Chapter ID**: `007-ai-bash-companion`
**Title**: "Bash for Developers: How Your AI Companion Works With the Command Line"
**Branch**: `07-bash-revision`
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: Specification Ready for Planning

---

## Vision Statement

This chapter **does NOT teach bash** as a traditional skill. Instead, it teaches readers to **understand and collaborate with their AI companion** as it uses bash on their behalf.

**Core Learning Goal**: "When your AI companion suggests a bash command, you understand WHAT it's doing, WHY it matters, and whether it's safe to execute."

**Paradigm Shift**:
- **Not**: "Memorize 100 bash commands"
- **YES**: "Understand the 8-10 bash patterns your AI uses most frequently"
- **Not**: "Learn to write complex bash"
- **YES**: "Learn to ask clear questions and verify AI's responses"
- **Not**: "Bash is hard, technical knowledge"
- **YES**: "Bash is your AI companion's interface; you're the quality checker"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1: Understanding File Navigation (Priority: P1)

**Scenario**: A learner receives AI suggestions that involve `cd`, `pwd`, `ls` commands. They need to understand what the AI is doing with the filesystem.

**Why P1**: Navigation is foundational—every bash interaction involves knowing where you are. If learners don't understand this, they'll fear breaking things.

**Independent Test**: Learner can read an AI-generated bash command involving file navigation, explain what it does and where on disk it operates, and predict the outcome before execution.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** AI suggests `cd ~/project && ls -la`, **When** learner reads it, **Then** learner can explain: "Move to home/project folder and list files with details"
2. **Given** AI suggests `mkdir -p src/{tests,models,utils}`, **When** learner reads it, **Then** learner can draw the resulting folder structure
3. **Given** AI suggests `rm -rf old_project`, **When** learner considers it, **Then** learner can identify this is destructive and asks for confirmation

---

### User Story 2: Understanding Configuration and Environment (Priority: P1)

**Scenario**: Learner needs to set API keys, configure tools, or set environment variables. AI companion suggests commands like `export API_KEY="..."` or edits to `~/.bashrc`.

**Why P1**: Modern development requires configuration. Learners must understand how their system is configured and how to verify AI's configuration changes.

**Independent Test**: Learner can read AI-generated configuration commands, understand what system variable is being set, explain where it persists, and verify it was applied correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** AI suggests `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-..."`, **When** learner executes it, **Then** learner can verify it's set with `echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
2. **Given** AI edits `~/.bashrc` to add a new export, **When** learner views the file, **Then** learner can identify the new line and understand it persists across sessions
3. **Given** configuration needs to be changed, **When** learner works with AI, **Then** learner can decide between temporary (export) vs. permanent (~/.bashrc) solution

---

### User Story 3: Understanding File Operations and Safety (Priority: P1)

**Scenario**: AI suggests operations like copy, move, delete. Learner must understand what data moves where and identify destructive operations before they happen.

**Why P1**: Data loss prevention is critical. Learners must develop safety instincts and understand backup patterns that AI suggests.

**Independent Test**: Learner can read copy/move/delete commands from AI, trace what data is affected, identify if backups are suggested, and decide if the operation is safe before executing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** AI suggests `cp old_file.py backup_file.py`, **When** learner reads it, **Then** learner understands: creates copy, original unchanged
2. **Given** AI suggests `mv src/ old_src/ && mkdir src/`, **When** learner analyzes it, **Then** learner recognizes this as "rename src to old_src, create new empty src"
3. **Given** AI suggests destructive operation, **When** learner reviews the plan, **Then** learner asks "Should we backup first?" and AI adjusts the plan

---

### User Story 4: Understanding Package Installation and Dependencies (Priority: P2)

**Scenario**: AI companion suggests installing packages with `pip install`, `npm install`, or `brew install`. Learner must understand what's being installed, where it goes, and how to verify success.

**Why P2**: Essential for real projects but slightly less critical than navigation/configuration/safety. Learners will encounter this frequently but with clear AI guidance.

**Independent Test**: Learner can read package installation commands, understand what dependency is being added, where it's installed, and verify success with appropriate check commands.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** AI suggests `pip install requests`, **When** learner executes it, **Then** learner can verify with `python -m pip list | grep requests`
2. **Given** AI suggests `npm install --save express`, **When** learner reviews it, **Then** learner understands this adds to package.json and installs to node_modules
3. **Given** installation fails, **When** learner works with AI, **Then** learner understands the error message and AI's debugging approach

---

### User Story 5: Understanding Process Management and Monitoring (Priority: P2)

**Scenario**: AI suggests commands to check running processes, manage background tasks, or stop services. Learner must understand what's running and how to safely manage it.

**Why P2**: Important for real development (servers, services) but not needed until later chapters when learners build running applications.

**Independent Test**: Learner can read process management commands from AI, understand what's running or what will change, and decide if it's safe to execute.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** AI suggests `ps aux | grep python`, **When** learner reviews it, **Then** learner understands: "show running processes, filter for python"
2. **Given** a server is running, **When** AI suggests `kill -9 <PID>`, **Then** learner understands this force-terminates that process
3. **Given** background process blocking work, **When** AI helps diagnose, **Then** learner learns the troubleshooting pattern

---

### User Story 6: Understanding Pipes and Command Chaining (Priority: P2)

**Scenario**: AI suggests complex commands combining multiple bash tools: `cat file.txt | grep "error" | wc -l`. Learner must understand the flow of data and purpose of each command.

**Why P2**: Essential for real problem-solving but easier to learn through guided examples than by memorizing.

**Independent Test**: Learner can read piped commands from AI, trace how output flows through each step, and explain the final result.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** AI suggests `ls -la | grep ".py" | wc -l`, **When** learner reads it, **Then** learner can trace: "list → filter → count" and predict it shows Python file count
2. **Given** complex pipeline from AI, **When** learner reviews it with AI, **Then** learner asks "What does each part do?" and AI explains step-by-step
3. **Given** need to filter/search files, **When** learner works with AI, **Then** learner requests explanation of the pattern before executing

---

### User Story 7: Understanding Error Messages and Troubleshooting (Priority: P3)

**Scenario**: Command fails with error. AI interprets the error, suggests fixes. Learner must understand what went wrong and why the fix works.

**Why P3**: Critical for real work but learners will develop this through repeated exposure. Can be scaffolded from earlier stories.

**Independent Test**: Learner encounters command error from AI, reads AI's explanation, understands the root cause, and verifies the fix works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** "command not found" error, **When** AI suggests checking PATH or installing, **Then** learner understands why command failed
2. **Given** "permission denied" error, **When** AI suggests chmod, **Then** learner understands file permissions caused the issue
3. **Given** any bash error, **When** learner reads AI's explanation, **Then** learner can identify the root cause

---

### Edge Cases

- What if learner's AI suggests a command that's different from their OS (e.g., macOS vs. Linux)?
- How does learner verify AI's suggestions are following security best practices (no hardcoded secrets)?
- What if learner doesn't have admin privileges (sudo) for an operation AI suggests?
- How does learner recognize when AI's bash command might cause data loss?
- What happens when API key configuration is wrong and how does learner debug it?
