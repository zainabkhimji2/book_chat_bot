## Progression Track 2: "Business Models & Market Strategy"

### Track Arc
How students progress from recognizing opportunity to building viable business strategy.

```
Chapter 1: Awareness
└─ L1: Recognizing AI-Era Opportunity Timing (A1)
    └─ "2025 is different"
       ↓ (builds on)
Chapter 3: Strategy Development
├─ L1: Recognizing AI Opportunity Window (A1) ✓ SAME CONCEPT, DEEPER
│  ├─ "Here's what makes 2025 special"
│  └─ L1: Evaluating Personal Opportunity (A2) ✓ APPLIES
│     └─ "What's YOUR opportunity?"
├─ L2: Recognizing Competitive Layer Structures (A1)
│  └─ "Here are four layers; which one should you target?"
│  └─ L2: Evaluating Layer Selection (A2) ✓ PERSONAL APPLICATION
│     └─ "Which layer is RIGHT FOR YOU?"
├─ L3: Recognizing Economic Scalability (A2)
│  └─ "Here's why solo devs can build billion-dollar companies"
├─ L5: Understanding Vertical Market Strategy (A1)

    └─ "All three elements required; missing any = failure"
       ↓ (builds on)
Chapter 4: Professional Positioning
└─ L1: Recognizing Paradigm Shifts (A1) ✓ CONTEXTUALIZES
   └─ "This strategy game is completely different from before"

### Proficiency Progression
- Ch1, L1 (A1): "Something significant happened in 2025"
- Ch3, L1 (A1→A2): "Here's what happened; what's YOUR move?"
- Ch3, L2-L6 (A1→A2): "Here's competitive framework; here's strategic playbook; can you execute it?"
- Ch4, L1 (A1): "This represents a complete paradigm shift"

### Progression Issues Found & Fixed
❌ **Issue**: Ch3, L1 introduces "Recognizing AI Opportunity Window" (A1) and immediately jumps to "Evaluating Personal Opportunity" (A2)
   - **Problem**: Student hasn't yet seen frameworks to evaluate
   - **Fix**: Move "Evaluating Personal Opportunity" to Ch3, L7 (after all frameworks presented)

❌ **Issue**: "Evaluating Market Risk & Timing" appears in Ch3, L5 (A2) but no A1 foundational skill "Recognizing Market Risk"
   - **Problem**: A2 skill with no A1 prerequisite
   - **Recommendation**: Add A1 skill in L5 before jumping to A2

- Ch1, L5 (A2): "Where do YOU fit?"
- Ch1, L8 (A2): "What do YOU need to learn?"
- Ch4, L5 (A2): "Which complementary domains interest YOU?"

### Assessment Validation
✓ **Clear A1→A2→B1 progression**: Moves from "what's changing" → "where do I fit" → "what's my plan"
✓ **Personalization emphasis**: Consistent emphasis on personal assessment/evaluation
✓ **Realistic timeline**: Skills build over entire Part 1, not compressed

## Progression Track 4: "Systems Thinking & AIDD Framework"

### Track Arc
How students progress from understanding AI amplifies existing patterns to appreciating complete system integration.

```
Chapter 2: Foundational Concept
└─ L3: Understanding AI as Amplifier (A1)
    └─ "AI amplifies whatever you bring to it—good or bad"
       ↓ (builds on)
Chapter 2: DORA Framework Application
└─ L3: Recognizing DORA Capabilities (A1)
    └─ "Here are seven capabilities that determine amplification success"
       ↓ (builds on)
Chapter 4: Complete System Framework
├─ L2: Understanding AIDD Definition (A1)
│  └─ "AIDD is specification-first methodology with nine characteristics"
├─ L3: Understanding Nine Pillars (A1)
│  └─ "These nine technologies make AIDD possible; they interconnect"
├─ L4: Understanding Pillar Mechanics (A1)
│  └─ "Here's deep dive into each pillar; see how they integrate"
└─ L6: Understanding Systems Completeness (A1→A2)
    └─ "Missing ANY pillar creates bottlenecks; all nine amplify each other"
    └─ "Assess YOUR completeness; plan path to full adoption"

### Proficiency Progression
- Ch2, L3 (A1): Simple concept: "AI amplifies"
- Ch2, L3 (A1): Framework application: "Here are seven drivers"
- Ch4, L2-L4 (A1): Complete system: "Here's complete framework with nine pillars"
- Ch4, L6 (A1→A2): Systems thinking: "You need all nine; assess gaps; plan adoption"

### Assessment Validation
✓ **Scaffolded complexity**: Moves from simple concept → framework → complete system
✓ **Proper sequencing**: Foundations (Ch2) before complete system (Ch4)
✓ **Build on prior knowledge**: Ch4 explicitly references Ch2 concepts
✓ **Appropriate final complexity**: A2 proficiency in L6 is reasonable after building foundation

## Critical Issues Found & Recommendations

### Issue 1: "Evaluating" Skills Overuse
**Finding**: 20+ skills use "Evaluating" as primary verb, creating confusion

**Examples**:
- Evaluating Career Relevance (A2)
- Evaluating Personal Opportunity (A2)
- Evaluating Personal Learning Strategy (A2)
- Evaluating Layer Selection (A2)
- Evaluating Market Risk (A2)

**Problem**: Different cognitive actions all labeled the same way; students can't distinguish between assessment types

**Recommendation**: Use distinct verbs:
- **Assessing** = determining current state (readiness, competency, position)
- **Evaluating** = judging quality/fitness for purpose
- **Prioritizing** = making strategic choices among options
- **Personalizing** = adapting frameworks to individual context

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Create verb clarity guide for skill naming
- [ ] Audit Part 1 skills and rename for clarity
- [ ] Apply updated naming to Part 2+

---

### Issue 2: A1→A2 Prerequisite Gaps
**Finding**: Some A2 skills lack explicit A1 prerequisite

**Examples**:
- Ch3, L3: "Recognizing Economic Scalability Patterns" (A2) — no A1 "Understanding Economic Principles"
- Ch3, L5: "Evaluating Market Risk & Timing" (A2) — no A1 foundation

**Problem**: Students may struggle if they don't understand A1 foundations

**Recommendation**: Add A1 skills or explicitly note prerequisites in frontmatter

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Add missing A1 prerequisites
- [ ] Update YAML frontmatter with explicit prerequisite field
- [ ] Update chapter-planner to enforce prerequisite checking

---

### Issue 3: Missing Cross-Chapter Skill Depth
**Finding**: Some skills introduced in Ch1 are never deepened (no A2 version)

**Examples**:
- "Recognizing CS Education Gaps" (A1) appears only in Ch1, L8
- "Understanding Curriculum Lag" (A1) same issue
- "Evaluating Evidence Quality" (A2) never progresses to B1

**Problem**: Skills aren't carried through to deeper learning; appear isolated

**Recommendation**: For foundational skills, ensure they appear at A1 AND A2 across chapters

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Identify skills that should have deeper progression
- [ ] Plan A2 versions in later chapters
- [ ] Plan B1 versions for Part 2+

---

### Issue 4: Business Domain Skills Lack Interconnection
**Finding**: Business strategy skills (Ch3) don't clearly show how they build on each other

**Example Sequence**:
- L1: Opportunity Window (A1)
- L2: Competitive Layers (A1)
- L3: Economic Scaling (A2)
- L5: PPP Strategy (A1)

**Problem**: It's not clear how L1→L2→L3→L5 form coherent progression

**Recommendation**: Explicit dependency mapping in learning objectives

**Example**:
```yaml
learning_objectives:
  - objective: "Understand PPP requires understanding opportunity (L1), layers (L2), and economics (L3)"
    prerequisite_lessons:
      - chapter: 3
        lesson: 1
        skill: "Recognizing AI Opportunity Window"
      - chapter: 3
        lesson: 2
        skill: "Recognizing Competitive Layer Structures"
      - chapter: 3
        lesson: 3
        skill: "Recognizing Economic Scalability Patterns"
```

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Add prerequisite_lessons field to YAML
- [ ] Explicitly document why Ch3 skills build on each other
- [ ] Create visual dependency map for students

|-----------|--------|---------|
| **No skill fragmentation** | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Some skills appear with different names (e.g., "Recognizing AI's Impact" vs. "Understanding AI Impact") |
| **Proficiency progression** | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Some A2 skills lack A1 prerequisites |
| **Clear sequencing** | ✓ GOOD | Ch1 → Ch2 → Ch4 progression generally sound |
| **Cognitive load alignment** | ✓ GOOD | All lessons within concept limits |
| **Naming consistency** | ❌ NEEDS WORK | "Evaluating" overused; verbs not distinguished |
| **Cross-chapter coherence** | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Some skills isolated; Ch3 dependencies unclear |

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Part 1 Cleanup (Before Part 2)
1. **Rename skills for clarity** (verb distinction: assess/evaluate/prioritize/personalize)
2. **Add missing A1 prerequisites**
3. **Extend isolated A1 skills to A2 in later chapters**
4. **Document Ch3 skill dependencies** (make interconnection explicit)

### Phase 2: Master Registry Implementation
1. **Create feedback loop**: When chapter-planner adds new skills, validate against registry
2. **Add prerequisite enforcement**: Warn if A2 skill lacks A1 prerequisite
3. **Add assessment rubrics**: For each skill at each proficiency level
4. **Create visual progression maps**: For each domain

### Phase 3: Student Experience
1. **Generate skill badges**: Show students which skills they've mastered
2. **Create learning pathways**: Allow students to choose skill progression paths
3. **Provide competency transcripts**: Document what students can do
4. **Enable employer integration**: Export skill data to hiring platforms
