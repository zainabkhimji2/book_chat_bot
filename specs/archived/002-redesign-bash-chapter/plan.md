# Bash Chapter Redesign: Detailed Implementation Plan

**Specification**: `/specs/002-redesign-bash-chapter/spec.md`
**Chapter Type**: Technical + Dialogue-First (Part 2, Chapter 7)
**Branch**: `002-redesign-bash-chapter`
**Created**: 2025-11-02
**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Model**: Claude Haiku 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

This plan transforms the current bash chapter from a command-focused tutorial into a **dialogue-first, AI-centered learning experience**. The core innovation is teaching bash through natural conversations between learner and AI companion (Claude Code, Gemini CLI) rather than isolated command syntax.

**Key Paradigm Shift**:
- FROM: Command lists with syntax → isolated terminal exercises
- TO: Natural dialogue flow → learner requests → AI executes → output → explanation → safety questions

**Chapter Scope**: 8 lessons, 270-340 minutes (~4.5-5.5 hours), progressive complexity from A1 (recognition) to A2 (simple application)

**Core Innovation**: Every bash concept appears **only** within authentic dialogue examples, never in isolation. Learner develops understanding through conversation patterns, not syntax memorization.

---

## Chapter Overview & Learning Path

### Target Audience
- **Prior Knowledge**: Completed Chapter 6 (Claude Code / Gemini CLI introduction) + basic computer literacy
- **Motivation**: "I want to understand what my AI is doing when it works in the terminal"
- **Key Insight**: AI companion is doing work on learner's behalf; learner's job is to understand, verify, and supervise

## Example Sourcing

**All 30+ Dialogue Examples Must Be**:
- ✅ Sourced from real Claude Code / Gemini CLI interactions OR
- ✅ Clearly marked "to be sourced during implementation"
- ✅ Never fabricated
- ✅ Documented with source information

**Sources Table** (to be completed during implementation):

| Example | Lesson | Type | Source Status |
|---------|--------|------|----------------|
| 1-1 through 1-3 | 1 | pwd/ls dialogue | To be sourced |
| 2-1 through 2-3 | 2 | Safety pattern | To be sourced |
| [Continue for all lessons...] | | | |

---

## Edge Cases & Learner Variations

### OS Differences (macOS vs. Linux vs. Windows)
- Strategy: AI companion handles platform differences in dialogue
- All examples annotate if OS-specific
- Encourage learners to ask: "Does this work on my system?"

### Missing Tools
- Strategy: Agent suggests alternatives or explains fallback
- Example: "find isn't available. Let's use ls -R instead"

### Platform-Specific Commands
- Always verify command exists before using
- Suggest alternatives if unavailable
- Never assume specific tools

---

## Safety Pattern (Recurring Theme)

**Ask → Explain → Understand → Verify → Execute**

Explicitly taught in Lesson 2; reinforced in every subsequent lesson through dialogue.

**Why This Matters**:
- Learners develop HABIT, not just knowledge
- Pattern repetition becomes automatic
- Verification before trust becomes instinct
- Dialogue is natural; not a "lecture"

---
