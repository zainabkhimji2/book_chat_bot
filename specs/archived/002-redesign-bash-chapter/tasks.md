## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all lesson implementation
- **User Stories (Phases 3-9)**:
  - All depend on Foundational phase
  - US1, US2, US3 (P1) should complete before US4, US5, US6 (P2)
  - All can proceed in parallel once Foundational is done
- **Integration (Phase 10)**: Depends on all user stories complete
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on Integration
- **Deployment (Phase 12)**: Depends on Polish

### User Story Execution Order

```
Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
    ↓
Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T015)
    ├─ All can run in parallel
    ↓
Phase 3: US1 - File Navigation (T016-T019)
    ├─ Lesson 1 (T016): pwd, ls in dialogue
    └─ Lesson 3 (T017): Navigation paths

    Parallel with US1:
    ├─ Phase 4: US2 - File Operations (T020-T023)
    │   ├─ Lesson 2 (T020): Safety pattern
    │   └─ Lesson 4 (T021): cp/mv/rm safely
    │
    ├─ Phase 5: US3 - Configuration (T024-T026)
    │   └─ Lesson 5 (T024): export vs ~/.bashrc
    │
    └─ Phase 6: US4 - Packages (T027-T029)
        └─ Lesson 6 (T027): pip/npm installation

    After P1 stories complete:
    ├─ Phase 7: US5 - Process Management (T030-T031)
    ├─ Phase 8: US6 - Pipes (T032-T034)
    └─ Phase 9: US7 - Safety Culture (T035-T043)
        └─ All lessons (safety reinforced throughout)
```

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 Setup**: All T001-T005 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 2 Foundational**: All T006-T015 can run in parallel (sourcing/documentation)
- **User Story Phases**: Once Foundational complete, all US phases can run in parallel:
  - Different lessons (different files)
  - Different user stories (independent learning)
- **Within Each Lesson**:
  - Sourcing dialogues (T006-T012) can run in parallel
  - Creating dialogues for multiple lessons can run in parallel
- **Phase 11 Polish**: All T051-T056 marked [P] can run in parallel (validation tasks)

---

## Parallel Example: Complete US1 and US2 Simultaneously

```
Once Foundational (Phase 2) complete:

PARALLEL TRACK 1 (US1 - Navigation):
  T016: Create Lesson 1 (pwd, ls)
  T017: Create Lesson 3 (paths, navigation)
  T018: Add mistakes to lessons
  T019: Create validation checklist

PARALLEL TRACK 2 (US2 - File Operations):
  T020: Create Lesson 2 (safety pattern)
  T021: Create Lesson 4 (cp/mv/rm)
  T022: Add backup patterns
  T023: Create validation checklist

Both tracks complete independently and in parallel.
Then validate both stories work together.
```

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 11 Validation

```
All validation tasks [P] can run in parallel:

T051: Verify all commands accurate (different validator)
T052: Verify CEFR alignment (different validator)
T053: Check cognitive load (different validator)
T054: Verify exercises (different validator)
T055: Verify assessments (different validator)
T056: Validate authenticity (different validator)

All run simultaneously, then consolidate results.
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First: User Story 1 Only (Phase 3)

To deliver minimum viable chapter:

1. ✅ Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. ✅ Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T015)
3. ✅ Complete Phase 3: US1 - Navigation (T016-T019)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Lessons 1 & 3 complete, learners can understand navigation through dialogue
5. Gather feedback and iterate

**Time**: ~2-3 weeks for MVP

### Incremental Delivery: Add Lessons Progressively

1. MVP: US1 (Lessons 1, 3) - File navigation
2. Add: US2 (Lessons 2, 4) - File operations + safety pattern
3. Add: US3 (Lesson 5) - Configuration
4. Add: US4 (Lesson 6) - Packages
5. Add: US5, US6 (Lesson 7, 8) - Processes, pipes, capstone
6. Polish & deploy

**Each increment**: Independently testable and deployable

### Parallel Team Strategy (If Multiple Writers)

```
With 3 content creators:

Week 1-2:
  Team: Complete Setup + Foundational together

Week 3-4:
  Writer 1: US1 (Lesson 1, 3) - Navigation
  Writer 2: US2 (Lesson 2, 4) - File operations
  Writer 3: US3 (Lesson 5) - Configuration

Week 5:
  Writer 1: US4 (Lesson 6) - Packages
  Writer 2: US5 (Lesson 8 section) - Processes
  Writer 3: US6 (Lesson 7) - Pipes

Week 6:
  All: US7 (Safety throughout all lessons)
  All: Integration, Polish, Validation

Week 7-8:
  All: Final review, fixes, deployment
```

## Notes & Policy

### Lesson Authoring Policy

**CRITICAL**: Each lesson MUST end with a single final section titled **"Try With AI"**:

```markdown
## Try With AI

[5-minute interactive activity using Claude Code or learner's AI tool]

**Tool**: ChatGPT web (Part 2, before tool introduction) OR
         Learner's preferred AI CLI (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.)

**Prompt 1**: [Natural language request demonstrating dialogue pattern]
**Expected Outcome**: [What learner should understand after this]

**Prompt 2**: [Extension or next step]
**Expected Outcome**: [Verification that learning objective achieved]
```

**NO "Key Takeaways"** - Learning happens through dialogue, not summary lists
**NO "What's Next"** - Next lesson flows naturally from this one

### Dialogue Authenticity

- All dialogue examples MUST be from real Claude Code or Gemini CLI interactions
- Document source in SOURCES.md
- If example not yet available, mark "To be sourced during implementation"
- Fabricated examples are FORBIDDEN
- Verify all dialogue reads naturally (not forced or artificial)

### Cognitive Load

- A1 lessons (1-2): Max 5 new concepts
- A2 lessons (3-7): Max 7 new concepts
- B1 transition (8): Max 7-8 concepts
- Count concepts and flag if exceeded

### Safety Culture

- Every lesson must surface safety through dialogue (not warning boxes)
- Safety pattern explicitly taught in Lesson 2
- Reinforced in every lesson after
- Learners should naturally ask "Is this safe?" by lesson end
