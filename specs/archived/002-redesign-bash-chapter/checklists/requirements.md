# Specification Quality Checklist: Redesign Bash Chapter with Interactive Dialogue Pattern

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-02
**Feature**: [Bash Redesign Spec](../spec.md)
**Branch**: `002-redesign-bash-chapter`

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs (understanding bash through collaboration with AI)
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (learners new to terminal)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - Each functional requirement specifies a measurable learning outcome
  - Content requirements are observable (dialogue sourcing, structure, verification)
  - Success criteria are measurable (confidence ratings, skill demonstrations, percentages)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - SC-001 through SC-007 include specific metrics (under 30 seconds, 4+/5, 90%+)
  - Quality metrics QM-001 through QM-006 are verifiable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - Criteria describe learning outcomes, not tool choices or code structures
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - 7 user stories with P1/P2 priorities
  - 3-4 acceptance scenarios per story (21 total)
  - Each scenario follows Given/When/Then format
- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - 6 edge cases documented (OS differences, missing tools, platform-specific commands, etc.)
  - All relate to real learner scenarios
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - In-Scope and Out-of-Scope sections explicitly defined
  - Scope limited to dialogue-based learning, not script writing or advanced bash
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - 6 explicit assumptions (A1-A6) documented
  - Prerequisites clearly stated (Chapter 6 completion, basic computer literacy)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - FR-001 through FR-010 map to user stories and acceptance scenarios
  - CR-001 through CR-006 (content requirements) are observable
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - Navigation (P1), File Operations (P1), Configuration (P1), Safety (P1)
  - Packages (P2), Process Management (P2), Pipes (P2)
  - Real project setup with errors (final lesson)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - All 7 measurable learning outcomes connect to chapter lessons
  - All 6 quality metrics are verifiable through content review
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - Spec describes WHAT learners will understand, not HOW to teach it
  - No mentions of specific Markdown structures, styling, or delivery tools

## Specification Strengths

1. **Clear Paradigm Shift**: Explicitly moves from syntax-first to dialogue-first teaching
2. **User-Centered**: 7 prioritized user stories with P1/P2 ratings based on value
3. **Safety Emphasis**: P1 priority given to safety culture and verification habits
4. **Authentic Examples**: Requirements explicitly demand real Claude Code / Gemini CLI examples
5. **Progressive Complexity**: Lessons 1-3 foundation, Lessons 4-8 building real scenarios
6. **Quality Gates**: Content requirements (CR-001-006) ensure execution quality

## Notes and Context

**Why Dialogue-First Approach?**

Proofreader feedback indicated the current chapter (7) causes confusion because it teaches bash commands in isolation. Learners fixate on syntax (what the `-la` flag does) rather than understanding the *pattern* of working with AI companions (request → execution → understanding).

The redesigned chapter reframes learning around **conversation**, where every bash command appears in a natural dialogue context. This aligns with the book's core philosophy: "AI is your copilot; you're supervising execution and verifying outcomes."

**Key Innovation**: The specification doesn't teach bash—it teaches how to have productive conversations with AI about bash. This is fundamentally different from traditional CLI education and aligns with the AI-native development paradigm.

## Checklist Status

✅ **SPECIFICATION APPROVED FOR PLANNING PHASE**

All items pass. This specification is ready for the `/sp.plan` phase where the chapter-planner agent will:
1. Break spec into 8 detailed lesson plans
2. Map each lesson to learning objectives and skills proficiency levels
3. Identify code examples and assessment questions
4. Create implementation tasks with acceptance criteria
