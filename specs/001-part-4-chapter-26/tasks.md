# Tasks: Chapter 26 - Meta Classes and Data Classes

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-part-4-chapter-26/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required)

**Organization**: Tasks are organized by lesson to enable sequential implementation with review checkpoints.

**Chapter Context**: Advanced Python chapter teaching metaclasses and dataclasses with equal 50/50 depth. No capstone project—conceptual mastery with focused examples.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Lesson] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Lesson]**: Which lesson this task belongs to (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5)

## Path Conventions

All lessons are in: `docs/part-4-python-fundamentals/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Lesson 1 (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion
- **Lesson 2 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Lesson 1 completion (builds on metaclass foundation)
- **Lesson 3 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Setup completion (independent of metaclass lessons)
- **Lesson 4 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Lesson 3 completion (builds on dataclass basics)
- **Lesson 5 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Lessons 1-4 completion (synthesis requires all prior lessons)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all lessons being complete

### Lesson Dependencies

- **Lesson 1**: Standalone (introduces metaclass fundamentals)
- **Lesson 2**: Requires Lesson 1 (applies metaclass patterns)
- **Lesson 3**: Standalone (introduces dataclass fundamentals)
- **Lesson 4**: Requires Lesson 3 (applies advanced dataclass features)
- **Lesson 5**: Requires Lessons 1-4 (compares and synthesizes both topics)

### Within Each Lesson

- Content development before code examples
- All code examples can be created in parallel [P]
- Code examples before AI-Native Learning section
- AI-Native Learning section before validation
- All validation tasks can run in parallel
- Lesson complete before moving to next lesson

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Lesson 1)**:
- T011, T012, T013, T014 (all code examples) can run in parallel

**Phase 3 (Lesson 2)**:
- T028-T033 (all 6 code examples) can run in parallel

**Phase 4 (Lesson 3)**:
- T046-T050 (all 5 code examples) can run in parallel

**Phase 5 (Lesson 4)**:
- T063-T068 (all 6 code examples) can run in parallel

**Phase 6 (Lesson 5)**:
- T081-T084 (all 4 code examples) can run in parallel

**Phase 7 (Polish)**:
- T094, T095, T096 can run in parallel

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Sequential Lesson Development (Recommended)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Lesson 1 → **VALIDATE** → Human review checkpoint
3. Complete Phase 3: Lesson 2 → **VALIDATE** → Human review checkpoint (metaclass coverage complete)
4. Complete Phase 4: Lesson 3 → **VALIDATE** → Human review checkpoint
5. Complete Phase 5: Lesson 4 → **VALIDATE** → Human review checkpoint (dataclass coverage complete)
6. Complete Phase 6: Lesson 5 → **VALIDATE** → Human review checkpoint (synthesis complete)
7. Complete Phase 7: Polish → Final chapter validation

### Parallel Development Strategy (Advanced)

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Phase 1: Setup together
2. Once Setup done:
   - **Developer A**: Lesson 1 → Lesson 2 (metaclass track)
   - **Developer B**: Lesson 3 → Lesson 4 (dataclass track)
   - **Developer C**: Chapter polish and cross-references
3. All complete before Lesson 5 (requires both tracks)
4. Team reviews Lesson 5 together (synthesis requires all context)

### Quality Gates

**After Each Lesson**:
- All code examples tested on Python 3.14+
- Type hints validated (100% coverage)
- Cognitive load validated (≤10 concepts)
- Reading level checked (Grade 10-11)
- Lesson ends with "Try With AI" ONLY

**After Chapter Complete**:
- 50/50 balance verified (metaclass vs dataclass depth)
- Total duration 3.5-4.5 hours
- No forward references
- Part 4 appropriate language
- Constitutional compliance

---

## Policy Note for Lesson Authors

**Lesson Closure Pattern** (Constitutional Requirement):
- Each lesson MUST end with a single final section titled **"Try With AI"**
- NO "Key Takeaways" section
- NO "What's Next" section
- NO "Summary" section after Try With AI

**AI Tool Instructions**:
- Before AI tools are taught (Parts 1-3): Use ChatGPT web in "Try With AI" sections
- After tool onboarding (Part 4+): Instruct learners to use their preferred AI companion tool
- Optionally provide both CLI and web variants for flexibility

**For Chapter 26 (Part 4)**:
Learners have been introduced to AI tools. "Try With AI" sections should say:
> "Use your preferred AI companion (Claude CLI, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) to explore these prompts."

## Notes

- Total tasks: 100 (comprehensive chapter implementation)
- Estimated effort: ~45-55 story points (5 lessons × ~9-11 SP each)
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- [Lesson] label maps task to specific lesson for traceability
- Each lesson should be independently reviewable and testable
- Stop at each checkpoint to validate lesson quality before proceeding
- Commit after each lesson or logical group
- Avoid: vague tasks, cognitive overload, missing validation steps
