**Part**: Part 4 (Python Fundamentals, Chapters 12-29)

**Feature Branch**: `001-part-4-chapter-26`
**Chapter Objective(s)**:
- Explain metaclasses as Python's class creation mechanism and when they solve real problems
- Create dataclasses for clean, type-safe data modeling with minimal boilerplate
- Compare and choose the appropriate tool (metaclass vs. dataclass vs. traditional class) for different scenarios
- Read and understand framework source code using these advanced patterns (Django, SQLAlchemy)

**Estimated Total Time**: 3.5-4.5 hours (per EVAL-011)
**Total Lessons**: 5 (equal 50/50 depth for metaclasses vs. dataclasses)

## Overview & Evals Summary

This chapter teaches two advanced Python features that sit at opposite ends of the spectrum:

- **Metaclasses** (Lessons 1-2): The machinery that creates classes. Powerful but specialized. Students learn the mechanism (`type`, `__new__`, `__init__`), practical patterns (validation, registration, singleton), and real-world framework usage (Django ORM, SQLAlchemy).

- **Dataclasses** (Lessons 3-4): Modern, declarative data containers. Practical and widely-used. Students master core features (`@dataclass`, type hints, auto-generated methods), then advanced features (`field()`, `__post_init__()`, metadata, frozen/unfrozen).

- **Synthesis** (Lesson 5): Compare approaches and make informed architectural decisions.

**Success Criteria** (connected to evals EVAL-001 through EVAL-014):
- ✅ 75%+ can explain metaclasses (EVAL-001, EVAL-002)
- ✅ 80%+ can create metaclasses solving real problems (EVAL-005)
- ✅ 85%+ can create and use dataclasses effectively (EVAL-006)
- ✅ 80%+ completion rate on all lessons (EVAL-009)
- ✅ 75%+ complete "Try With AI" exercises (EVAL-010)
- ✅ Average time 3.5-4.5 hours (EVAL-011)
- ✅ Grade 10-11 reading level (EVAL-012)
- ✅ All code examples run Python 3.14+ (EVAL-013)

- Chapter 14-16 (Type hints): Required for dataclass syntax

---

## Content Scaffolding Strategy

**Part A: Metaclasses (Lessons 1-2) - 50% of chapter**
1. Reveal mechanism first (Lesson 1): HOW classes are created before WHY customize
2. Show practical patterns (Lesson 2): Real problems where metaclass makes sense
3. Compare alternatives: Always ask "Why not just use a decorator?"

**Part B: Dataclasses (Lessons 3-4) - 50% of chapter**
1. Start with simplicity (Lesson 3): Auto-generated methods eliminate boilerplate
2. Add complexity gradually (Lesson 4): Each feature adds practical capability
3. Ground in real problems: API models, configuration, validation

**Part C: Synthesis (Lesson 5)**
1. Compare side-by-side: Same problem solved three ways
2. Framework insights: Why Django chose metaclass, why Pydantic uses dataclasses
3. Decision framework: Heuristic for choosing the right tool

**Cognitive Load Management**:
- Each lesson: 10 concepts (or 8 for synthesis) - at advanced B1-B2 tier limit
- Concepts build on prior lessons (metaclass concepts reused in comparison)
- Code examples progress: B1 → B1-B2 → B2 within and across lessons
- No regression in proficiency (smooth B1 → B1-B2 → B2)

## Integration Points

**Prior Chapters** (Prerequisites):
- **Chapter 24**: OOP Part I - classes, inheritance, special methods (REQUIRED)
- **Chapter 25**: OOP Part II - decorators, class methods, advanced methods (REQUIRED)
- **Chapter 20**: Functions - decorator pattern understanding (REQUIRED for comparisons)
- **Chapter 14-16**: Type hints - required for dataclass syntax (REQUIRED)

**Subsequent Chapters** (Lookahead only, no forward refs):
- Chapter 27: Pydantic and Generics (builds on dataclasses)
- Chapter 28: Asyncio (async dataclasses)
- Chapter 29: CPython and GIL (performance implications)

---

## AI-Native Learning Integration

**Every lesson follows this pattern**:
1. **Describe Intent**: Start with "Why would I need this?" or "What problem does this solve?"
2. **Explore with AI**: Use AI as co-reasoning partner to trace through mechanism or implement patterns
3. **Validate**: Run code, inspect behavior, verify understanding
4. **Learn from Errors**: Explore what breaks and why (understanding through failure)

**Try With AI sections**:
- 4 prompts per lesson
- Bloom's progression: Recall → Understand → Apply → Analyze/Evaluate/Synthesize
- Positioned as final section in each lesson (no separate Key Takeaways)
- Students ask AI to build solutions; learn by evaluating what AI produces

---

## Validation Strategy

**How students demonstrate understanding**:

**Lessons 1-2 (Metaclasses)**:
- Trace through metaclass execution mentally
- Identify when metaclass is appropriate vs decorator
- Read framework code and spot metaclass patterns
- Implement validation or registration pattern

**Lessons 3-4 (Dataclasses)**:
- Create dataclass with type hints and auto-generated methods
- Use `field()`, `__post_init__()`, InitVar appropriately
- Validate dataclass data and handle invalid input
- Serialize/deserialize dataclasses to JSON

**Lesson 5 (Synthesis)**:
- Analyze problem and choose appropriate tool
- Explain framework design decisions
- Compare tradeoffs and justify choice
- Read existing code and identify patterns

---

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation | Prevention |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Metaclasses seem "magical" | L1 emphasizes tracing through `__new__`/`__init__` step-by-step | Avoid "advanced magic" language; frame as normal class creation |
| Mutable default gotcha confuses | L4 emphasizes `default_factory`; show both wrong and right way | Early mention in L3 that L4 covers correct approach |
| Confusion about which to use when | L5 explicitly compares and contrasts with decision matrix | Throughout lessons, reinforce these are orthogonal problems |
| Time management - chapter dense | 45-65 min per lesson, fits 3.5-4.5 hour target | Clear checkpoints at lesson ends; validate understanding before moving on |
| Code examples don't run | All must test on Python 3.14+ with 100% type hints | Technical review validates all examples run error-free |
| Reading level too high | EVAL-012 requires Grade 10-11; use clear language, short sentences | Peer review for readability; avoid academic jargon |
