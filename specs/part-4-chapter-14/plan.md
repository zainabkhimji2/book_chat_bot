# Chapter 14: Data Types — Detailed Implementation Plan

**Chapter Type**: Technical / Code-Focused
**Chapter Objective(s)**: Students understand what data types are, how to use core types (int, float, str, bool, None), validate types with `isinstance()`, and recognize collection types with appropriate type hints.
**Estimated Total Time**: 3.5–4 hours (5 lessons × 40–50 min each)
**Part**: Part 4 - Python Fundamentals
**Complexity Tier**: A2-B1 (Intermediate Beginners)
**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Feature Branch**: `014-data-types`

---

## 🎯 Chapter Overview & Context

**Building on Chapter 13 Foundation**:
- Chapter 13 taught: What is Python, Installing Python, Running code, `print()` function
- Chapter 14 builds on this by teaching: Variables, type hints as specifications, data types, type validation

**Bridge to Chapter 15**:
- Chapter 14 establishes solid type foundation
- Chapter 15 (Operators) builds on type understanding—students will apply types to arithmetic operations

**AI-Native Learning Pattern** (how students learn Python with AI):
- **Describe intent**: Type hints describe what data means (`age: int = 25` says "age is a number")
- **Explore with AI**: Students ask AI "What can I do with this type?" instead of reading documentation
- **Validate together**: `type()` and `isinstance()` let students check their understanding
- **Learn from errors**: When TypeError occurs, ask AI "why?" to deepen learning

**Key Scope Boundaries** (Chapter 14 Responsibility):
- ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: int, float, str (basics), bool, None, type hints, `type()`, `isinstance()`
- ✅ **Awareness Only**: Collections (list, tuple, dict, set) — deep dive deferred to Chapters 18-19
- ❌ **Deferred**: Operators (Ch 15), String methods (Ch 16), Control flow (Ch 17), Collection methods (Ch 18-19)

print(bool([1,2]))    # True (non-empty list)
```
- **Purpose**: Understand boolean values; recognize truthy/falsy patterns
- **Complexity**: Intermediate (conceptual understanding)
- **Key Insight**: "In Python, many values can be evaluated as True or False—this matters when we write conditions"

**Code Example 3: Type Conversion**
```python
# Converting between types safely
# int() - convert to integer
age_string: str = "25"
age_integer: int = int(age_string)  # 25 (conversion works)
print(f"Age as integer: {age_integer}")

# str() - convert to string
age_number: int = 25

**Code Example 4: None Type**
```python
# None - represents "no value"
middle_name: str | None = None  # Person might not have middle name
user_email: str | None = None   # User hasn't provided email yet

# Using None to indicate "not set"
if user_email is None:
    print("Email not provided yet")
else:
    print(f"Email: {user_email}")

# None is falsy
if not None:
    print("None is falsy in boolean contexts")  # This prints
```

print(type(person))           # <class 'dict'>
print(type(unique_numbers))   # <class 'set'>
```
- **Purpose**: Introduce collection type hint syntax (from Python 3.9+)
- **Complexity**: Intermediate (syntax pattern, modern Python)
- **Key Insight**: "Type hints communicate what kind of items are in each collection"
- **Note**: Modern syntax (`list[int]`) vs. older syntax (`List[int]`) — we use modern

**Code Example 3: Collection Awareness (When to Use Each)**
```python
# When to use each collection type

# List - when order matters and items might change
to_do_list: list[str] = ["Buy groceries", "Walk dog", "Read chapter"]
# → Can add/remove items, order matters

# Tuple - when order matters but items don't change
date: tuple[int, int, int] = (2025, 11, 8)  # year, month, day
# → Can't change items, but position has meaning

# Dictionary - when looking up values by key (fast lookup)
student_grades: dict[str, int] = {
    "Alice": 95,
    "Bob": 87,
    "Charlie": 92
}
# → Fast lookup by name; don't care about order

# Set - when uniqueness is important
visited_countries: set[str] = {"USA", "Canada", "Mexico", "USA"}
# → Automatically removes duplicates; no order
```
- **Purpose**: High-level guidance on when to use each collection
- **Complexity**: Beginner (conceptual patterns)
- **Key Insight**: "Choose collection type based on whether you need ordering, mutability, or uniqueness"
- **Note**: This is awareness only—practical examples come in Chapters 18-19

**Practice Approach**:
- **Exercise 1**: Create a list, tuple, dict, set with type hints
- **Exercise 2**: Use `type()` to verify each collection's type
- **Exercise 3**: Predict what type hint each collection should have
- **Exercise 4 (Awareness Check)**: When would you use list vs. tuple? Dict vs. set?

- **Purpose**: Integrate all Chapter 14 type concepts in working program
- **Complexity**: Intermediate (functions, return type hints, user output)
- **Size**: ~70 lines (manageable, focused)
- **Key Concepts Demonstrated**:
  - Type hints throughout (annotations on variables, function return types)
  - `type()` function to inspect types
  - `isinstance()` function to validate types
  - Type conversion (`int()`, `str()`, `bool()`)
  - Comments documenting purpose
  - Function structure (preparation for Chapter 20)

- **Comments for AI Extension Points**:
```python
# ASK YOUR AI: "How can I add user input to this explorer?"
# ASK YOUR AI: "Can I add more type checks or conversions?"
# ASK YOUR AI: "How would I add list/dict exploration here?"
# (Reminder: Lists/dicts comprehensive coverage in Ch 18-19)
```

**Practice Approach**:
- **Task 1**: Run the type explorer; understand each function's output
- **Task 2**: Modify one function (e.g., change the int value from 42 to 99); observe changes
- **Task 3**: Create new function to explore a different type (copy pattern from existing functions)
- **Task 4**: Use `isinstance()` in one of your own programs; validate before using value

**End-of-Lesson: Try With AI**

## 🎓 Lesson Closure Pattern

**CRITICAL DESIGN RULE**: Each lesson ends with ONLY the "Try With AI" section. NO separate "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next" sections.

**Why**: The "Try With AI" prompts serve as cognitive closure and engagement point. Adding traditional closing sections creates cognitive overload and duplicates content.

**Structure** (Consistent Across All 5 Lessons):
1. Content delivery (explanation + code examples + practice)
2. **Try With AI** (exactly 4 prompts with expected outcomes)
3. [END OF LESSON - No closing sections]

**Engagement Strategy**:
- Last prompt in each Try With AI is always reflective ("What did you learn?")
- Reflection connects current lesson to next (Chapter 15 for L1-4; capstone integration for L5)
- AI dialogue naturally concludes lesson by connecting backward (what was taught) and forward (what's next)

## 📝 Next Steps After Plan Approval

1. **Generate Task Checklist** → `/sp.tasks` command creates `chapter-14-tasks.md`
2. **Implement Lessons** → Lesson-writer subagent uses plan + tasks to write content
3. **Create Code Examples** → All code examples tested in Python 3.14.0+
4. **Generate Assessments** → Quizzes and exercises per task checklist
5. **Technical Review** → Technical-reviewer validates type hints, syntax, constitutional alignment
6. **Deploy to Docusaurus** → Integrate into book build system

## ✨ Quality Assurance Checklist

**Pedagogy**:
- ✅ Lessons follow A2-B1 progression (foundation → application)
- ✅ Cognitive load managed (max 7 concepts per lesson)
- ✅ Each lesson has single, measurable learning objective
- ✅ Scaffolding is explicit (worked examples → guided practice → independent application)
- ✅ All lessons end with "Try With AI" only (no Key Takeaways/What's Next)

**Alignment**:
- ✅ All lessons aligned to approved spec
- ✅ No forward references to Chapters 15-29
- ✅ Chapter boundaries respected (collections awareness only, deep dive in Ch 18-19)
- ✅ AI-Native Learning pattern integrated (describe intent: type hints; explore with AI: dialogue; validate: isinstance; learn from errors: TypeError troubleshooting)
- ✅ Built on Chapter 13 (print function reinforced throughout)

**Skills**:
- ✅ 12 distinct skills mapped to lessons with CEFR proficiency levels
- ✅ Skills progress A1→A2→B1 without regression
- ✅ Prerequisites satisfied (variables before types before validation)
- ✅ Skills connected in progression track (not isolated)
- ✅ Cognitive load validated for each proficiency level

**Code Examples**:
- ✅ All examples use Python 3.14+ with type hints
- ✅ Examples progressively build understanding
- ✅ All examples will be tested (mypy/pyright)
- ✅ Code follows style guide (naming, formatting, comments)
- ✅ No external dependencies in Chapter 14 examples

**Engagement**:
- ✅ Each lesson has concrete learning objective
- ✅ Try With AI prompts are specific and actionable
- ✅ Expected outcomes clearly stated
- ✅ Safety notes included for error scenarios
- ✅ Connection to Chapter 15 established
