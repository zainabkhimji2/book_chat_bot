## Topic Summary *(mandatory)*

**Building on Chapter 13's Hello World Foundation**:

Chapter 13 teaches: What is Python + Installing Python + Hello World with `print()`

Chapter 14 builds on this by teaching:
1. **Variables with Type Hints**: Store data with specification-first code
2. **Data Types Foundation**: Understand types through AI partnership, not syntax memorization

Students arrive knowing `print()` from Hello World. Chapter 14 teaches them to **store data in variables** AND understand **what types are and why they matter**.

**Core Philosophy**: Types aren't syntax to memorize - they're concepts to explore. Students use Claude Code or Gemini CLI as their co-learning partner to discover "what can I do with this type?" through dialogue.

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Create variables with type hints (builds on Chapter 13's print())
- Understand type concept and type() function
- Work with core types (int, float, str, bool, None)
- Explore collections awareness (list, tuple, dict, set)
- Build simple type explorer demonstrating type operations

**AI-Native Learning Pattern**:
- **Describe intent**: Type hints describe what data means (`age: int` says "age is a number")
- **Explore with AI**: Ask AI "what can I do with this type?" instead of reading documentation
- **Validate together**: Use isinstance() and type() to check understanding
- **Learn from errors**: When TypeError occurs, ask AI "why?" to deepen learning

---

## Prerequisites *(mandatory)*

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Variables with Type Hints (Priority: P1)

**As a Python beginner**, I want to store data in variables with type hints, so I can write clear, specification-first code building on my Hello World knowledge.

**Why this priority**: Foundation skill - variables with type hints enable all future Python work. Type hints introduce specification-first thinking from first variables.

**Independent Test**: Student can create variables (int, float, str, bool) with type hints and use print() (from Ch 13) to display values.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student completed Hello World (Chapter 13), **When** they learn variables, **Then** they create `age: int = 25` to store data

2. **Given** a student sees type hints, **When** they ask AI "why add `: int` to variables?", **Then** they understand type hints as embedded specifications

3. **Given** a student creates multiple variables, **When** they use different types (int, float, str, bool), **Then** they see Python categorizes data

4. **Given** a student uses print(), **When** they display variable values, **Then** they build on Chapter 13 Hello World to show stored data

---

### User Story 2 - Understanding Data Types through Numbers (Priority: P1)

**As a learner**, I want to understand what a data type is by exploring int and float through AI dialogue, so I grasp "type as capability" concept.

**Why this priority**: Foundational concept - understanding "what is a type?" is critical before learning specific types.

**Independent Test**: Student can explain "what is a type?" in own words, use type() function, and choose int vs float appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student asks "what is a data type?", **When** AI explains types as categories determining operations, **Then** they understand type concept

2. **Given** a student uses type() function, **When** they inspect different values, **Then** they see Python categorizes data

3. **Given** a student learns int and float, **When** they ask AI "when should I use int vs float?", **Then** they understand counting (int) vs measuring (float)

4. **Given** a student encounters TypeError, **When** they ask AI "why did this fail?", **Then** they understand type mismatch and use isinstance() to validate

---

### User Story 3 - Strings and Booleans Understanding (Priority: P2)

**As a learner**, I want to understand str (text basics), bool (True/False), None, and type conversion, so I can work with text and boolean logic in my programs.

**Why this priority**: Essential for real programs (text input/output, conditional logic) - builds on numeric foundation.

**Independent Test**: Student can create strings with type hints, understand truthy/falsy values, convert between types safely, and use None appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student learns str basics, **When** they create strings with type hints, **Then** they understand `name: str = "Alex"` syntax (deep dive in Chapter 16)

2. **Given** a student explores bool, **When** they ask AI "why is 0 falsy but -1 truthy?", **Then** they understand boolean evaluation context

3. **Given** a student needs type conversion, **When** they ask AI "how do I convert user input (string) to integer?", **Then** they use int() and understand when it fails

4. **Given** a student sees None, **When** they ask AI "what is None and when should I use it?", **Then** they understand "no value" concept

---

### User Story 4 - Collection Awareness (Priority: P3)

**As a learner**, I want **conceptual introduction** to collections (list, tuple, dict, set), so I know they exist and when to learn them deeply.

**Why this priority**: Awareness only - deep coverage happens in Chapters 18-19. Not critical for Chapter 14 completion.

**Independent Test**: Student can create basic list, tuple, dict, set with type hints, and knows where to find comprehensive coverage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student sees collections, **When** they ask AI "what's the difference between list, tuple, dict, and set?", **Then** they understand high-level purpose of each

2. **Given** a student learns type hints for collections, **When** they write `scores: list[int]`, **Then** they understand collection type hint syntax

3. **Given** a student asks about collection methods, **When** they see "defer to Chapter 18-19", **Then** they know where comprehensive coverage is

**CRITICAL**: This story provides **awareness only**, not mastery. Full coverage in Chapters 18-19.

---

### User Story 5 - Building Type Explorer with Core Types (Priority: P1)

**As a learner**, I want to build an interactive type explorer applying core type concepts (int, float, str, bool, None), so I solidify understanding through hands-on practice.

**Why this priority**: Capstone project integrating all Chapter 14 core concepts - critical for mastery before Chapter 15.

**Independent Test**: Student completes working type explorer for core types with type hints, isinstance() validation, type conversion, and AI-guided extensions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student has learned core types, **When** they build type explorer program, **Then** they apply int, float, str, bool, None with type hints

2. **Given** a student needs type validation, **When** they use isinstance(), **Then** they check types before operations

3. **Given** a student handles user input, **When** they convert types with int(), float(), str(), **Then** they handle conversion failures with AI help

4. **Given** a student has working explorer, **When** they ask AI "how can I improve this?", **Then** they extend it with AI-suggested features

---

### Edge Cases

- **Empty Collections**: What happens when `list`, `dict`, `set` are empty? (Falsy in boolean context)
- **Type Conversion Failures**: When does `int("abc")` fail? How to handle gracefully?
- **Integer Division**: What's the difference between `/` (float division) and `//` (integer division)?
- **Float Precision**: Why does `0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3` in Python? (IEEE 754 floating point)
- **Complex Number Operations**: What operations work on complex numbers vs real numbers?
- **None Type**: When is `None` used and how does it behave in boolean contexts?
- **Truthy/Falsy Confusion**: Why is `[] == False` false but `if []:` doesn't execute?
- **Bytes vs String**: When should you use `bytes` instead of `str`?

## Notes *(clarifications and context)*

**Why AIDD-First Approach for Types?**

Traditional Python teaching: "Here are 12 data types. Memorize their methods."

AIDD-first approach: "Types define what you can DO with data. Use AI to explore what each type enables."

**Example of the difference**:

**Traditional**:
> "Strings have 47 methods: `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.split()`, `.join()`, ... [memorize all]"

**AIDD-First**:
> "Strings are text. Ask your AI: 'What can I do with text in Python?' Discover operations as you need them."

**Pedagogical Benefits**:
1. **Reduces cognitive load**: Explore on-demand vs memorize upfront
2. **Builds AI partnership**: Students learn to ask questions, not look up docs
3. **Focuses on concepts**: Understand "why types exist" before "how to use them"
4. **Mirrors real work**: Professional developers ask AI about types constantly

**Ruthless Context Filtering AND Chapter Boundary Respect**:

Chapter 14 focuses on **core type concepts** + **collection awareness**. Deep dives deferred to later chapters.

- **Chapter 17**: Control flow (if/else, loops) - not yet taught
- **Chapter 18**: Lists, Tuples, Dictionary (comprehensive: methods, operations, use cases)
- **Chapter 19**: Set, Frozenset (set operations, mathematical operations, GC basics)
- **Chapter 20**: Functions - not yet taught
- **Chapter 21**: Exception handling - not yet taught
- **Chapter 22**: File handling - not yet taught

❌ **SKIPPED** (Too Advanced or Out of Scope):
- Integer literals and interning (advanced Python internals)
- Memory space sharing details (Chapter 29 - CPython and GIL)
- File handling examples (Chapter 22 - IO and File Handling)
- Number systems deep dive (ASCII, hex, octal, binary) - keep minimal
- UTF-8 encoding details (Chapter 16 or Chapter 22)
- Binary types (bytes, bytearray, memoryview) - too advanced for Chapter 14

**Critical Design Rules Applied**:

1. **User Intent is Authority**: User requested core types first (int, float, str, bool) + collection awareness → spec reflects this priority
2. **Chapter Boundary Respect**: Strings deep dive (Ch 16), Collections deep dive (Ch 18-19) - Chapter 14 provides foundational awareness
3. **No Forward References**: Zero mentions of operators (Ch 15), control flow (Ch 17), functions (Ch 20), classes (Ch 24+)
4. **Ruthless Filtering**: Only Chapter 14 scope from context materials - deferred advanced topics
5. **Minimal Files**: This spec only (plan.md and tasks.md come later)
6. **Troubleshooting is AI Partnership**: "Ask AI when TypeError occurs" pattern
7. **Standardized Try With AI Format**: Exactly 4 prompts per lesson with expected outcomes

**Key Scope Decision**: Chapter 14 teaches **type concept + core types comprehensively** + **collection awareness**. This enables students to:
- Understand "what is a type and why it matters" (foundation)
- Work with int, float, str, bool, None confidently (immediate utility)
- Know collections exist and use type hints (`list[int]`) (future preparation)
- Be ready for Chapter 15 (Operators) with solid type foundation

## Next Steps

After spec approval:

1. **Run /sp.plan**: Break spec into detailed lesson-by-lesson implementation plan with CEFR proficiency levels
2. **Run /sp.tasks**: Generate implementation task checklist with acceptance criteria
3. **Optional - Run lesson-writer**: Implement lessons with AIDD teaching pattern applied
4. **Run technical-reviewer**: Validate technical accuracy and constitution alignment

**Spec Ready For**: Planning phase (`/sp.plan`)
