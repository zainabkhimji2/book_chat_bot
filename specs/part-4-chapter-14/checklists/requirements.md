# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 14 - Data Types (Revised)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-08
**Revised**: 2025-01-08 (Core types + collection awareness scope)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - ✅ Spec describes types conceptually, not Python internals
  - ✅ Teaching approach, not technical implementation

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - ✅ Success evals measure student learning outcomes
  - ✅ User stories prioritize learning goals

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - ✅ Readable by educators and curriculum designers
  - ✅ Avoids jargon; explains "AIDD-first approach"

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - ✅ Success Evals, User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria present

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - ✅ Zero clarification markers in spec
  - ✅ All design decisions documented in Assumptions section

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - ✅ FR-001 through FR-012 specific and measurable
  - ✅ Example: "MUST cover all Python built-in types" (testable via content review)

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - ✅ SC-001: "75%+ can explain type concept" (quiz metric)
  - ✅ SC-005: "100% build working type explorer" (submission)
  - ✅ SC-010: "70%+ completion rate on Try With AI" (analytics)

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - ✅ All success criteria measure learning outcomes, not technical specs
  - ✅ Example: "Students understand types through AI dialogue" not "Uses FastAPI for quizzes"

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - ✅ 6 user stories with Given/When/Then scenarios
  - ✅ Each scenario independently testable

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - ✅ 8 edge cases documented (empty collections, type conversion failures, float precision, etc.)

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - ✅ Prerequisites explicit (Chapters 1-13 only)
  - ✅ Out of scope explicit (functions, classes, exceptions, file I/O)
  - ✅ Ruthless filtering applied to context materials

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - ✅ Prerequisites section lists required prior chapters
  - ✅ Assumptions section documents defaults and teaching environment

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - ✅ FR-001 → Acceptance: "All Python built-in types covered"
  - ✅ FR-003 → Acceptance: "Every lesson has 4 Try With AI prompts"
  - ✅ FR-008 → Acceptance: "Students build interactive type explorer"

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - ✅ P1 (Priority 1): Type concept, numeric/boolean exploration
  - ✅ P2: Sequences, mapping/sets, type conversion
  - ✅ P3: Capstone project

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - ✅ Success Evals aligned with Success Criteria
  - ✅ SC-001 through SC-012 directly measurable

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - ✅ Spec describes WHAT students learn, not HOW lessons are coded
  - ✅ Code examples are specifications, not implementations

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All checklist items satisfied

**Key Strengths**:
1. Comprehensive success evals with measurable metrics
2. Clear user stories prioritized by learning value (core types first, collections awareness)
3. AIDD-first approach clearly articulated
4. Ruthless scope filtering AND chapter boundary respect applied
5. Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all decisions documented)
6. **Revised scope**: Core types (int, float, str, bool, None) comprehensive + collections awareness only

**Revision Summary** (2025-01-08):
- ✅ Fixed: Reordered content (core types first: int, float, str, bool)
- ✅ Fixed: Deferred strings deep dive to Chapter 16
- ✅ Fixed: Deferred collections (list, tuple, dict) to Chapter 18
- ✅ Fixed: Deferred sets (set, frozenset) to Chapter 19
- ✅ Fixed: 5 lessons (down from 6) - focused on core types + collection awareness
- ✅ Confirmed: Chapter 13 DOES teach type hints (verified in actual lessons)

**No Issues Found**: Revised spec ready for planning phase

---

## Notes

**AIDD-First Validation**:
- Spec consistently reinforces AI partnership pattern
- "Try With AI" format standardized across all lessons (Rule 7)
- Troubleshooting with AI pattern integrated (Rule 6)

**Pedagogical Validation**:
- Cognitive load limits applied (max 7-8 concepts per lesson)
- Complexity tier A2-B1 appropriate for universal audience
- No forward references to Chapters 15-29

**Technical Validation**:
- Python 3.14+ standards specified
- Type hints required in all examples
- Modern syntax only (f-strings, list[int], X | None)

---

## Recommendation

✅ **APPROVE FOR PLANNING**

Specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/sp.plan` phase.

No revisions required. Proceed to lesson-by-lesson breakdown with CEFR proficiency mapping.
