## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Lesson 1 (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion
- **Lesson 2 (Phase 3)**: Can start in parallel with Lesson 1 (different files)
- **Lesson 3 (Phase 4)**: Can start in parallel with Lessons 1-2 (different files)
- **Lesson 4 (Phase 5)**: Can start in parallel with Lessons 1-3 (different files)
- **Lesson 5 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Lessons 1-4 conceptual completion (integrates all prior content)
- **Integration (Phase 7)**: Depends on all lessons complete
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on Integration complete

### Lesson Dependencies

- **Lesson 1 (Variables)**: No dependencies - foundation lesson
- **Lesson 2 (Types Concept)**: Conceptually builds on L1 but can be written in parallel
- **Lesson 3 (Str/Bool)**: Conceptually builds on L2 but can be written in parallel
- **Lesson 4 (Collections)**: Conceptually builds on L1-3 but can be written in parallel
- **Lesson 5 (Capstone)**: Must integrate L1-4 content - write last

### User Story Mapping

- **User Story 1 (Variables with Type Hints - P1)**: Lesson 1
- **User Story 2 (Data Types through Numbers - P1)**: Lesson 2
- **User Story 3 (Strings and Booleans - P2)**: Lesson 3
- **User Story 4 (Collection Awareness - P3)**: Lesson 4
- **User Story 5 (Type Explorer Capstone - P1)**: Lesson 5

### Within Each Lesson

1. Introduction and context
2. Concept sections with code examples
3. "Try With AI" section (MUST be final section)
4. Test code examples in Python 3.14+
5. Validate output style compliance

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Phase 2-5 (Lessons 1-4)**: Can be written in parallel by different authors (different files)
- **Phase 6 (Lesson 5)**: Sequential - must wait for L1-4 conceptual completion
- **Phase 7 (Integration)**: Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Lessons 1-4

```bash
# Launch all lessons 1-4 together (different authors/sessions):
Task: "Write Lesson 1: Variables and Type Hints in 01-variables-and-type-hints.md"
Task: "Write Lesson 2: Integers and Floats in 02-integers-and-floats.md"
Task: "Write Lesson 3: Strings and Booleans in 03-strings-and-booleans.md"
Task: "Write Lesson 4: Collections Awareness in 04-collections-awareness.md"

# Then sequentially:
Task: "Write Lesson 5: Type Explorer Capstone in 05-type-explorer-capstone.md" (integrates all prior lessons)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Lessons 1-2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Lesson 1 (Variables)
3. Complete Phase 3: Lesson 2 (Types Concept)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test code examples, review content quality
5. Get feedback before proceeding

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup → Chapter structure ready
2. Add Lesson 1 → Test independently → Review
3. Add Lesson 2 → Test independently → Review
4. Add Lesson 3 → Test independently → Review
5. Add Lesson 4 → Test independently → Review
6. Add Lesson 5 (Capstone) → Test integration → Review
7. Run Integration & Polish phases → Chapter complete

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple lesson writers:

1. Team completes Setup together
2. Once structure is ready:
   - Writer A: Lesson 1 (Variables)
   - Writer B: Lesson 2 (Integers/Floats)
   - Writer C: Lesson 3 (Strings/Booleans)
   - Writer D: Lesson 4 (Collections)
3. After Lessons 1-4 complete:
   - Lead writer: Lesson 5 (Capstone - integrates all)
4. Team reviews together in Integration phase

---

## Critical Lesson Structure Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: All lessons MUST follow this structure:

### Required Lesson Elements

1. **Frontmatter** (YAML metadata)
2. **Introduction** (connection to prior chapter/lesson)
3. **Concept Sections** (with code examples)
4. **"Try With AI" Section** (MUST be final section)

### Forbidden Lesson Elements

- ❌ **"Key Takeaways"** section
- ❌ **"What's Next"** section
- ❌ **"Summary"** section (unless part of introduction)
- ❌ **"Exercises"** section (use "Try With AI" instead)

### Lesson Closure Policy

**Per constitution and output styles**: Lessons in this chapter MUST end with a single final section titled **"Try With AI"**. No other closure elements permitted.

**AI Tool Selection**:
- Before AI tools taught (Part 1): Use ChatGPT web
- After tool onboarding (Part 4+): Learner's preferred AI companion (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, ChatGPT)
- Optionally provide CLI and web variants in prompts

## Quality Gates

### Lesson-Level Quality Gates

Before marking any lesson complete, verify:

- [ ] All code examples tested in Python 3.14+
- [ ] Type hints validated with mypy/pyright
- [ ] Lesson ends with "Try With AI" only (no other closure)
- [ ] Reading level Grade 7-8 maintained
- [ ] No forward references to Chapters 15-29
- [ ] AI-Native Learning pattern applied (describe intent → explore → validate → learn from errors)
- [ ] Follows output style (`.claude/output-styles/lesson.md`)

### Chapter-Level Quality Gates

Before marking chapter complete, verify:

- [ ] All 5 user stories from spec.md addressed
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios covered
- [ ] Success evals achievable (comprehension, skill acquisition, type exploration, error recovery, capstone)
- [ ] Chapter progression logical (variables → types → str/bool → collections → capstone)
- [ ] No cognitive overload (max 7 concepts per lesson for A2-B1 tier)
- [ ] Chapter boundaries respected (defer operators to Ch 15, strings to Ch 16, collections to Ch 18-19)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- [L#] label maps task to specific lesson for traceability
- User stories map to lessons (not traditional development stories)
- Code examples are educational, not production code
- All Python code must use type hints (Python 3.14+ modern syntax)
- Tests are NOT needed (educational content, not software feature)
- Commit after each lesson completion
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate lesson quality
- Avoid: vague tasks, inconsistent terminology, cognitive overload (max 7 concepts/lesson)
