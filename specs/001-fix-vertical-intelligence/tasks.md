## Phase 1: Emergency Synchronization (2 Weeks)

### Week 1: Documentation Layer Fixes

#### Day 1-2: Constitution Update (FR-001 to FR-004)

- [X] T001 Add header section explaining "Current Reality" vs "Future State" distinction in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- [X] T002 Update Current Reality section: document 14 chapters across Parts 1/2/3/5 (not 55 chapters) - delegated to specs/book/chapter-index.md to avoid constant updates
- [X] T003 Update Current Reality section: document semantic skills activation model (current implementation) - already in v3.0.0, plugin-based architecture
- [X] T004 Move aspirational content (55 chapters, 13 parts, plugin architecture) to clearly-marked Future State section
- [X] T005 Update terminology throughout constitution: keep "lessons" terminology as-is (no change needed)
- [X] T006 Document two-level chapter structure explicitly: delegated to output-styles templates
- [X] T007 Update book statistics: clarify counts - delegated to specs/book/chapter-index.md for current status
- [X] T008 Add cross-references linking Current Reality sections to corresponding Future State sections
- [X] T009 Run AI validation scan comparing old vs new constitution terminology, generate evidence report in `specs/001-fix-vertical-intelligence/validation/layer-constitution-validation.md`

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 Week 1**: Constitution update → Output styles correction → PROJECT-STRUCTURE-REALITY.md creation (sequential within week, some parallelization possible)
- **Phase 1 Week 2**: Depends on Week 1 completion (subagents reference updated docs)
- **Phase 1 Day 10**: Depends on Days 1-9 completion (test chapter uses all corrected layers)
- **Phase 2 Week 3**: Depends on Phase 1 completion (benchmarks test corrected subagents)
- **Phase 2 Week 4**: Can start after Week 3 (independent user feedback system)
- **Phase 2 Week 5**: Week 5 Day 20-21 depends on Week 3 completion (drift detection validates against benchmark baseline)
- **Phase 2 Week 6**: Can start after Week 3 (uses benchmark suite for load testing)

### Within Phase 1

- T001-T010 (Constitution) must complete before T011-T019 (Output Styles) - subagents read constitution
- T011-T019 (Output Styles) must complete before T020-T028 (PROJECT-STRUCTURE-REALITY) - serves as examples source
- T020-T028 (PROJECT-STRUCTURE-REALITY) must complete before T029-T042 (Subagents) - subagents reference it
- T001-T042 (All docs) must complete before T054-T068 (Test Chapter) - test validates all layers

### Within Phase 2

- Week 3 (Benchmark Suite) must complete before Week 5 (Drift Detection) - uses benchmarks as baseline
- Week 3 (Evaluation) must complete before Week 6 Day 26 (Load Simulation) - uses benchmark suite for testing
- Week 4 (User Feedback) is independent - can run in parallel with Weeks 5-6

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1**:
- T002-T003 (constitution sections) can run in parallel
- T011-T015 (output styles files) can be updated in parallel
- T021-T026 (PROJECT-STRUCTURE-REALITY sections) can be written in parallel
- T029-T040 (subagent files) can be updated in parallel

**Phase 2 Week 3**:
- T069, T070, T071 (benchmark creation for 3 subagents) can run in parallel
- T072, T073, T074 (gold standard creation for 3 subagents) can run in parallel

**Phase 2 Week 4**:
- T105, T106 (GitHub issue templates) can be created in parallel

**Phase 2 Week 6**:
- T149-T156 (Multi-model orchestration) can overlap with T166-T173 (Cost control) - different systems

---

## Parallel Example: Constitution Update (Day 1-2)

```bash
# Can work on these sections concurrently:
Task: "Update Current Reality section: document 14 chapters..." (T002)
Task: "Update Current Reality section: document semantic skills..." (T003)
Task: "Update terminology throughout constitution..." (T005)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP: Phase 1 Only (Unblock Authors)

1. Complete Week 1 (Documentation Layer): Constitution, Output Styles, PROJECT-STRUCTURE-REALITY.md
2. Complete Week 2 (Execution Layer): Subagents, Validation Script, Test Chapter
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run end-to-end test chapter generation (Day 10)
4. If SC-001 to SC-007 all pass → Merge to main, unblock authors
5. Phase 1 delivers immediate value: authors can create content without contradictions

### Incremental Delivery

1. Phase 1 completion → **Deploy**: Authors have working, aligned system
2. Phase 2 Week 3 → **Add**: Evaluation framework gives quality metrics
3. Phase 2 Week 4 → **Add**: User feedback system enables data-driven improvement
4. Phase 2 Week 5 → **Add**: Adaptive intelligence prevents future drift
5. Phase 2 Week 6 → **Add**: Scalability infrastructure enables full 55-chapter scope
6. Each phase adds intelligence without breaking previous work

### Staged Rollout (Minimize Disruption)

**Phase 1 Merge** (Days 11-12 after Day 10 validation):
1. Merge constitution changes first (lowest risk)
2. Merge output styles (medium risk, templates only)
3. Merge PROJECT-STRUCTURE-REALITY.md (no risk, new file)
4. Merge subagent instructions (higher risk, test immediately after)
5. Merge validation script (no risk, new file)
6. Monitor for 2 days (Days 13-14), ready to hotfix

**Phase 2 Rollout** (incremental):
1. Week 3: Internal evaluation framework (no user impact)
2. Week 4: User feedback (optional, non-intrusive)
3. Week 5: Adaptive intelligence (background processes)
4. Week 6: Scalability (infrastructure optimization, transparent)

- ✅ Terminology Consistency Score = 100% across all 4 layers

## Notes

- **Validation approach**: Hybrid AI-human model (AI analyzes and presents evidence, human reviews and confirms)
- **Incremental checkpoints**: After each layer (constitution, output styles, subagents) - human go/no-go decision
- **Test-driven validation**: Day 10 test chapter proves workflow works end-to-end before merge
- **Data-driven**: All Phase 2 systems include quantitative metrics (>95%, >98%, >90%, 50+/month targets)
- **Rollback safety**: Keep backup of old constitution/subagent instructions for easy rollback if needed
- **Communication**: Announce changes to authors during Days 11-12 merge window
- **Metadata tracking**: All generated content includes comments showing source spec, tool, git author, workflow
- **Lesson author policy**: Within each chapter, lessons must end with single "Try With AI" section (no "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next")
