# Chapter 32 Quick Check Findings – Constitution v3.0.1 Subagent Alignment

**Validation Date**: 2025-11-04
**Chapter**: Chapter 32 – Real-World Spec-Kit Workflows & Capstone
**Test Focus**: Subagent compliance with updated constitution v3.0.1, output-styles alignment, chapter-index verification

---

## Quick Summary

✅ **STRUCTURE**: Chapter properly implements two-level hierarchy (README.md + 10 lesson files)
✅ **NAMING**: All files follow output-styles conventions (descriptive lesson names, correct case)
✅ **FRONTMATTER**: All lessons include required YAML metadata (title, chapter, lesson, duration, skills, learning_objectives)
✅ **PEDAGOGY**: Strong learning design with clear scaffolding, real-world examples, appropriate complexity
❌ **CLOSURE POLICY**: 3 lessons violate AI-first closure requirement (missing "Try With AI" in capstone lessons 8-9; "What's Next" after "Try With AI" in lesson 10)

## Subagent Quality Assessment

### What Works Well

1. **Output-Styles Compliance (`.claude/output-styles/lesson.md`)**
   - All 10 lessons include complete YAML frontmatter with skills metadata
   - Lesson structure follows adaptive content type pattern
   - Markdown formatting is publication-quality
   - Heading hierarchy is correct (H1 for lesson, H2 for sections, H3 for subsections)

2. **Chapter-Index Alignment (`specs/book/chapter-index.md`)**
   - Chapter metadata matches specification: Part 5, Chapter 32, status ✅ Implemented
   - Chapter title matches: "Real-World Spec-Kit Workflows & Capstone"
   - File location correct: `32-real-world-spec-kit-workflows/`

3. **Constitution v3.0.1 Alignment**
   - All 5 required domain skills present and contextually applied:
     - learning-objectives: ✓ Chapter README states 8 clear outcomes
     - concept-scaffolding: ✓ Progressive from solo → team → enterprise → hands-on
     - technical-clarity: ✓ Complex concepts explained through narrative + examples + steps
     - book-scaffolding: ✓ Proper structure with README + 10 lessons + clear progression
     - ai-collaborate-learning: ✓ Strong emphasis on AI orchestration and coordination
   - All ALWAYS DO rules followed: specs before implementation, diverse examples, error cases addressed
   - No NEVER DO rules violated: no gatekeeping language, no untested code claims, no assumed knowledge

4. **Pedagogical Design**
   - Learning path clarity: Excellent progression from abstract (specs as coordination) to concrete (capstone project)
   - Content elements appropriate to chapter type: Narrative + hands-on practice
   - Exercises well-designed with clear steps, reflection prompts, practical outcomes
   - All non-capstone lessons (1-7) correctly end with "Try With AI" sections

---

### What Needs Fixing

1. **AI-First Closure Policy Violation** (`.claude/output-styles/lesson.md`, lines 275, 283)
   - **Expected**: All lessons end with "## Try With AI" section (no "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next")
   - **Found**: 3 lessons violate this requirement

   | Lesson | Issue | Fix |
   |--------|-------|-----|
   | 08 | Missing "Try With AI"; ends with "What's Next" | Replace "What's Next" with "Try With AI" section |
   | 09 | Missing "Try With AI"; ends with "What's Next" | Replace "What's Next" with "Try With AI" section |
   | 10 | Has "Try With AI" but followed by "What's Next" | Delete "What's Next" section; ensure "Try With AI" is final |

2. **No Other Critical Issues Found**
   - All lessons have frontmatter ✓
   - All lessons have descriptive titles ✓
   - All lessons include learning objectives or skills metadata ✓
   - File naming conventions followed ✓
   - Markdown quality is professional ✓

## Validation Evidence

### Lesson Closure Pattern Verification

**Lessons 1-7 (Correct Pattern)**:
```
Lesson 01: "Watch Your Companions Coordinate"
  Line 306: ## Try With AI
  Line 326: [Expected Outcomes]
  Line 331: [Safety Note]
  ✓ No section after Try With AI
```

**Lesson 8 (Incorrect Pattern)**:
```
Lesson 08: "Capstone Part 1: Decompose Your Spec"
  Line 393: ## What's Next  ← SHOULD BE "## Try With AI"
  Line 399: [Content about moving to Part 2]
  ✗ Missing "Try With AI" entirely
```

**Lesson 9 (Incorrect Pattern)**:
```
Lesson 09: "Capstone Part 2: Implement in Parallel"
  Line 426: ## What's Next  ← SHOULD BE "## Try With AI"
  Line 432: [Content about moving to Part 3]
  ✗ Missing "Try With AI" entirely
```

**Lesson 10 (Incorrect Pattern)**:
```
Lesson 10: "Capstone Part 3: Reflect on Scale"
  Line 356: ## Try With AI  ✓ Correct section title
  Line 370: [Expected Outcomes]
  Line 388: ## What's Next  ← MUST BE DELETED
  ✗ "What's Next" should not appear after "Try With AI"
```

## Subagent Generation Quality

### Positive Findings

1. **Consistent Metadata**: All lessons include identical YAML structure (title, chapter, lesson, duration, skills array, learning_objectives array)
2. **Skill Descriptions**: Skills metadata is well-formed with proficiency levels (A1-B1) and categories (Conceptual, Technical, Soft)
3. **Learning Objectives**: Clear, measurable, using appropriate Bloom's taxonomy verbs for proficiency levels
4. **Content Quality**: Writing is publication-grade, engaging, with clear structure and real-world examples
5. **Pedagogical Soundness**: Lessons follow adaptive content-type patterns (conceptual vs. capstone practice)

### Issues Indicating Subagent Misalignment

1. **Closure Pattern Not Applied to Capstone Lessons**
   - Subagent (lesson-writer or chapter-writer) correctly applied "Try With AI" closure to lessons 1-7
   - For lessons 8-10 (capstone), subagent reverted to "What's Next" pattern
   - Indicates: Subagent may not have applied closure policy uniformly across all lesson types, or capstone lessons were generated with different context/instructions

2. **No Configuration Drift Detected**
   - Frontmatter is consistent
   - Naming is consistent
   - Structure is consistent
   - Issue is isolated to closure section pattern only

---

## Recommendations for Subagent Improvement

1. **Enforce Closure Policy Universally**: Add validation step in lesson-writer or chapter-writer to verify every lesson ends with "## Try With AI" (grep check before completion)

2. **Test Capstone Lessons Separately**: Capstone/practice lessons may need explicit instruction about closure policy in generation prompt

3. **Validation Script**: Add to subagent pipeline:
   ```bash
   # Verify no lesson ends with "Key Takeaway", "What's Next", or "Summary"
   grep -l "^## (Key Takeaway|What's Next|Summary)$" *.md && echo "FAIL: Prohibited closure pattern found" || echo "PASS"

   # Verify last H2 heading is "Try With AI"
   tail -100 lesson.md | grep -m1 "^##" | grep -q "Try With AI" && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL: Last section is not Try With AI"
   ```

4. **Documentation**: Update subagent prompts to explicitly state: "Every lesson MUST end with '## Try With AI' as the final section. Do NOT include 'Key Takeaways', 'What's Next', or 'Summary' sections. The 'Try With AI' section is the mandatory lesson closure."

## Conclusion

Chapter 32 demonstrates that updated subagents (aligned with constitution v3.0.1) work correctly for 70% of content (7/10 lessons, README structure, frontmatter, pedagogy). The isolated closure-policy issue in capstone lessons suggests:

1. ✅ Subagents correctly apply output-styles conventions
2. ✅ Subagents correctly apply constitution alignment
3. ✅ Subagents correctly structure YAML metadata
4. ❌ Subagents may need explicit instruction about lesson-closure universality across all lesson types

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 1 merge after applying the three lesson fixes. Document closure-policy issue as a minor subagent refinement for next iteration.
