# Validation Report: Chapter 31 (Spec-Kit Plus Hands-On)

**File:** `book-source/docs/05-Spec-Kit-Plus-Methodology/31-spec-kit-plus-hands-on/`
**Chapter Type:** Technical/Hybrid (mix of narrative + hands-on workflow lessons)
**Date:** 2025-11-04
**Constitution Version:** 3.0.1 (Evals-First, Specification-First, Validation-First)

---

## Executive Summary

**Status: REVISE & RESUBMIT**

Chapter 31 demonstrates strong pedagogical design and alignment with constitutional principles (Spec-First methodology, AI-as-co-reasoning-partner, evals-first validation). The chapter structure is well-conceived with clear learning progressions from project setup through implementation validation.

**Critical issues require fixing before publication:**
1. **Incomplete lesson**: Lesson 3 ends abruptly without "Try With AI" closure (missing ~50% of content)
2. **Non-compliant lesson closure**: Lesson 2 ends with "What's Next" instead of "Try With AI" (violates AI-first closure policy)
3. **Missing YAML frontmatter**: All lesson files lack `sidebar_position` field (required for Docosaurus)
4. **Typo**: "methadology" in lesson 1 (should be "methodology")

**Major issues** (addressable with localized edits):
1. **README.md formatting**: Learning objectives numbered starting at 3 (should start at 1)
2. **Incomplete lesson content**: Lessons 2 and 3 appear to have missing "Try With AI" sections per policy

**Minor issues** (polish):
- Lesson-to-lesson progression could be clearer in README overview
- A few examples could be more concrete

All code examples reference SpecifyPlus commands correctly and align with constitution's Spec-Kit Plus methodology emphasis. The chapter's pedagogical approach (scenario-based, tool-demonstration, validation-focused) is excellent and well-aligned with AI-first teaching philosophy.

## Critical Issues

**These MUST be fixed before approval:**

1. **CRITICAL - Incomplete Lesson 3**: File `03-building-specs-with-sp-specify.md` ends at line 143 without "Try With AI" section
   - **Location**: Lines 1-143 of `03-building-specs-with-sp-specify.md`
   - **Description**: The lesson covers specification anatomy and running `/sp.specify`, but abruptly ends after "What Makes a Spec Ready for Planning" section. Missing approximately 50% of expected content.
   - **Expected**: Lesson should include "Try With AI" section with concrete workflow prompts and expected outcomes (following pattern in lessons 1, 4, 5, 6)
   - **Recommendation**: Add ~40-50 lines containing:
     - "Try With AI" heading (H2)
     - Tool selection (Claude Code with `/sp.specify`)
     - Duration estimate (~10 minutes)
     - Workflow steps (1-5 steps mirroring spec usage)
     - Expected outcomes (4-5 bullet points)
   - **Reference**: See lessons 1, 4, 5, 6 for pattern (lines 195-238, 134-152, 155-174, 221-242 respectively)

2. **CRITICAL - Non-Compliant Lesson Closure**: File `02-complete-constitution.md` ends with "What's Next" section instead of "Try With AI"
   - **Location**: Lines 160-171 of `02-complete-constitution.md`
   - **Description**: Lesson 2 ends with "## What's Next" section containing narrative about next steps. This violates AI-first closure policy (Constitution Section V: "AI-first closure policy followed: each lesson ends with a single final 'Try With AI' section")
   - **Current content**: "## What's Next\n\nThe constitution is now established..."
   - **Policy violation**: Constitution states "no separate 'Key Takeaways' or 'What's Next' sections"
   - **Recommendation**: Replace "## What's Next" section with "## Try With AI" section following pattern from lessons 1, 4, 5, 6:
     - Tool selection (Claude Code or ChatGPT web)
     - Duration (~10-15 minutes)
     - Concrete workflow prompts (e.g., "Run `/sp.constitution` with your custom principles")
     - Expected outcomes demonstrating mastery
   - **Severity**: Constitutional non-compliance; affects publication readiness

3. **CRITICAL - Missing `sidebar_position` Frontmatter**: All 6 lesson files lack required YAML field
   - **Location**: YAML frontmatter (lines 1-40) of all lesson files:
     - `01-specifyplus-structure.md`
     - `02-complete-constitution.md`
     - `03-building-specs-with-sp-specify.md`
     - `04-planning-sp-plan.md`
     - `05-decomposing-tasks-sp-tasks.md`
     - `06-implementation-sp-implement.md`
   - **Description**: Output-Styles requirement `.claude/output-styles/chapters.md` mandates `sidebar_position: [N]` in YAML frontmatter for lesson ordering in Docosaurus
   - **Current state**: Lessons have `chapter` and `lesson` fields but not `sidebar_position`
   - **Impact**: Docosaurus sidebar will not render lessons in correct order
   - **Recommendation**: Add `sidebar_position: N` field to each lesson where N is the lesson number (1-6). Updated YAML should look like:
     ```yaml
     ---
     sidebar_position: 1
     title: "SpecifyPlus Setup & Project Structure"
     chapter: 31
     lesson: 1
     duration_minutes: 90
     skills: [...]
     ```
   - **Reference**: Output-Styles specification at `.claude/output-styles/chapters.md` lines 90-136

4. **CRITICAL - Typo in Lesson 1**: Misspelling of "methodology"
   - **Location**: Line 218 of `01-specifyplus-structure.md`
   - **Current text**: "If this spec is vague in SDD methadology, predict:"
   - **Correction**: Should be "If this spec is vague in SDD methodology, predict:"
   - **Type**: Typo (missing 'o'); appears in "Try With AI" → Prompts → 2. Trace the Cascade section

---

## Major Issues

**Significant issues that should be addressed before publication:**

1. **README.md Learning Objectives Numbering**: Chapter overview lists learning objectives starting at #3
   - **Location**: `README.md` lines 13-27
   - **Current format**:
     ```
     ## What You'll Learn

     By completing this chapter, you'll understand:

     3. How SpecifyPlus systematizes specification thinking
     4. Why Spec→Plan→Tasks→Code cascade works empirically
     5. How to use `/sp.specify` within Claude Code...
     ```
   - **Issue**: Numbering starts at 3 instead of 1; creates confusion (looks like items 1-2 are missing)
   - **Recommendation**: Renumber to start at 1-11 (or 1-10 depending on total count). Should read:
     ```
     1. How SpecifyPlus systematizes specification thinking
     2. Why Spec→Plan→Tasks→Code cascade works empirically
     3. How to use `/sp.specify` within Claude Code...
     [etc.]
     ```

2. **README Naming Convention Issue**: Chapter README uses `README.md` (uppercase) but violates naming convention
   - **Location**: `book-source/docs/05-Spec-Kit-Plus-Methodology/31-spec-kit-plus-hands-on/README.md`
   - **Context**: Output-Styles specifies:
     - Part-level: `README.md` (UPPERCASE) ✓
     - Chapter-level: `readme.md` (LOWERCASE) ✗ (this file is UPPERCASE)
   - **Issue**: File should be `readme.md` (lowercase) per output-styles convention at `.claude/output-styles/chapters.md` line 79
   - **Recommendation**: Rename file from `README.md` to `readme.md`
   - **Severity**: Style non-compliance (fixable with file rename)

3. **Incomplete Lesson 2 Content**: While lesson 2 has content through line 171, it may be missing intermediate "Try With AI" section before "What's Next"
   - **Location**: `02-complete-constitution.md` overall structure
   - **Observation**: Lesson structure is: Step 1-4 → "What's Next". Other lessons have interactive "Try With AI" sections between content and closure
   - **Reference**: Lessons 1, 4, 5, 6 all have dedicated "Try With AI" section with prompts before final closure
   - **Recommendation**: Add "Try With AI" section before "What's Next" with concrete `/sp.constitution` workflow prompts
   - **Impact**: Missing hands-on validation element that other lessons provide

---

## Minor Issues

**Style, clarity, or non-blocking suggestions:**

1. **Learning Objectives Clarity in README**: Chapter-level objectives could be better aligned with lesson-level objectives
   - **Location**: `README.md` lines 13-27 (chapter objectives) vs. individual lesson YAML files (lesson objectives)
   - **Observation**: Chapter lists 11 learning objectives (numbered 3-13), but there are 6 lessons. Could benefit from explicit mapping showing which lesson achieves which objective
   - **Recommendation** (Optional): Add subsection like "By Lesson:" showing mapping of objectives to lessons 1-6
   - **Severity**: Minor clarity issue; not blocking

2. **Tool Selection Consistency**: Lessons specify different tools in "Try With AI" sections
   - **Locations**:
     - Lesson 1: "ChatGPT web (or your AI companion if already set up)"
     - Lesson 4: "Claude Code with `/sp.plan` command"
     - Lesson 5: "AI Companion (Gemini CLI/Claude Code)"
     - Lesson 6: "Your AI Companion with `/sp.implement` command + validation"
   - **Observation**: Tool selection is context-appropriate (pre-tools vs. post-onboarding), but messaging could be clearer about progression from ChatGPT web to specific tools
   - **Recommendation** (Optional): Add note in chapter introduction explaining tool progression (Part 2 = ChatGPT web; Part 5+ = specific companion tool)
   - **Severity**: Minor; rationale for selection is sound per constitution

3. **Missing Context for `/sp.specify` vs `/sp.clarify` Relationship**: Lesson 3 mentions `/sp.clarify` but doesn't fully explain when to use it vs. `/sp.specify` alone
   - **Location**: `03-building-specs-with-sp-specify.md` line 129
   - **Text**: "You can optionally run `/sp.clarify` and your AI companion will ask a series of questions..."
   - **Gap**: Students don't know when "optionally" becomes "necessary" (e.g., after first spec iteration?)
   - **Recommendation** (Optional): Add one sentence clarifying: "Run `/sp.clarify` whenever your first `/sp.specify` output feels vague or incomplete"
   - **Severity**: Minor; learners can infer from context

4. **Example Typo in Lesson 1**: Minor spelling issues
   - **Additional typo found**: Line 218: "methadology" → should be "methodology"
   - **Context**: This is in the "Try With AI" section showing example spec output
   - **Impact**: Could confuse readers if they copy-paste prompts
   - **Recommendation**: Fix typo

## Detailed Findings

### Content Analysis

**Narrative Quality**:
- **Lesson 1 (Setup & Structure)**: Excellent pedagogical narrative
  - Opens with key insight: "folder structure enforces workflow"
  - Uses concrete "what breaks if you skip" examples (3 scenarios)
  - Progressive complexity: understand structure → recognize cascade → try with AI
  - "Try With AI" section uses reverse-engineering prompt (highest cognitive level) ✓

- **Lesson 2 (Constitution)**: Comprehensive but incomplete ending
  - Step-by-step instructions are clear and actionable
  - Constitution creation process is well-explained
  - BUT: Ends with "What's Next" narrative instead of "Try With AI" interactive section ✗
  - Cognitive load: 5 new concepts (Constitution Components, Component Relationships, Template as Tool, Ready for Planning, Revision Cycle) within A2 limit of 7 ✓

- **Lesson 3 (Building Specs)**: Strong start, abrupt incomplete ending
  - Specification anatomy diagram is excellent (clearly shows 6-part flow)
  - Running example (calculator spec) is concrete and relatable
  - Content through line 142 is solid and well-paced
  - **CRITICAL**: Abruptly ends without "Try With AI" section (appears to be incomplete delivery)
  - Expected missing content: ~40-50 lines of "Try With AI" workflow

- **Lesson 4 (Planning)**: Well-structured
  - Specification vs. Plan comparison table is effective (clarifies relationship)
  - Plan structure sections are logical (Phases → Dependencies → Milestones → Deliverables)
  - "Try With AI" section includes concrete workflow steps (1-5 steps) ✓
  - Cognitive load: 7 concepts within B1 limit of 10 ✓

- **Lesson 5 (Tasks)**: Clear task decomposition guidance
  - "What's an Atomic Task?" section defines criteria clearly (5 characteristics)
  - Task anatomy shows components (ID, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Dependencies, Priority, Effort)
  - Running calculator example threads through naturally
  - "Try With AI" section includes lineage tracing (excellent for comprehension) ✓

- **Lesson 6 (Implementation)**: Professional validation focus
  - AIDD Loop diagram is excellent visualization (6-step cycle clearly shown)
  - Emphasis on validation as "professional skill" aligns with constitution (Validation-First Safety)
  - Verification Checklist is comprehensive (7 acceptance criteria)
  - "Try With AI" section includes systematic validation workflow ✓

### Skill Metadata Analysis

**Proficiency Levels (CEFR)**:
- Lessons 1-3: A2 level (Understand, Apply) ✓
- Lessons 4-6: B1-B2 level (Apply, Analyze, Evaluate) ✓
- Progression is appropriate for chapter position (Part 5 of 13) ✓

**Cognitive Load**:
- Lesson 1: 5 concepts (within A2 limit of 7) ✓
- Lesson 2: 5 concepts (within A2 limit of 7) ✓
- Lesson 3: Not specified in frontmatter (should be ~5-7 for A2)
- Lesson 4: 7 concepts (within B1 limit of 10) ✓
- Lesson 5: 7 concepts (within B1 limit of 10) ✓
- Lesson 6: 10 concepts (at B1 limit of 10) ✓

### Pedagogical Structure Analysis

**Learning Path Clarity**:
- Chapter opens with chapter-level learning objectives (11 outcomes, numbered 3-13 — numbering issue noted)
- Each lesson has specific learning objectives tied to outcomes
- Running example (calculator spec → plan → tasks → implementation) threads consistently
- Clear prerequisite chain: Must understand structure before writing specs; must understand specs before planning

**Concept Dependencies**:
- Lesson 1 ← [prerequisite for all others]
- Lesson 2 ← Lesson 1 (must know structure before setting up constitution)
- Lesson 3 ← Lesson 2 (must have constitution to write specs)
- Lesson 4 ← Lesson 3 (must have spec to write plan)
- Lesson 5 ← Lesson 4 (must have plan to decompose tasks)
- Lesson 6 ← Lesson 5 (must have tasks to implement)

**Practice-to-Objective Alignment**:
- Lesson 1 Objective: "Explain project structure and cascade" → Practice: "Try With AI" traces cascade effects ✓
- Lesson 2 Objective: "Write constitution" → Practice: Missing "Try With AI"; only has step-by-step walkthrough ✗
- Lesson 3 Objective: "Use /sp.specify to iterate specs" → Practice: Content incomplete; no "Try With AI" ✗
- Lesson 4 Objective: "Generate plans and understand dependencies" → Practice: "Try With AI" includes dependency analysis ✓
- Lesson 5 Objective: "Decompose plans into tasks and trace lineage" → Practice: "Try With AI" explicitly traces lineage ✓
- Lesson 6 Objective: "Validate code against acceptance criteria" → Practice: "Try With AI" includes systematic validation ✓

**Identified Gaps**:
1. **Lesson 2**: Missing "Try With AI" interactive practice (has walkthrough but no hands-on validation)
2. **Lesson 3**: Incomplete content; needs "Try With AI" section to complete learning loop
3. **Chapter-level**: README learning objectives numbering (starts at 3 instead of 1) creates confusion

---

## Field Volatility & Maintenance Notes

**Topics Requiring Maintenance:**
- SpecifyPlus CLI commands (`/sp.specify`, `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, `/sp.implement`) — these may evolve as tool matures
- Tool versions: Chapter references "Python 3.12+" but should verify no breaking changes as Python 3.13+ becomes standard
- AI companion references: Chapter mentions "Claude Code", "ChatGPT web", "Gemini CLI" — may need updates as tools evolve

**Suggested Review Frequency:**
- Annually, or after SpecifyPlus major version updates (e.g., v2.0)
- Before publication: Verify all `/sp.*` commands match actual SpecifyPlus v1.x behavior

**Key Documentation Links to Verify**:
- SpecifyPlus documentation (when published) — verify command syntax and output
- Python 3.12+ official docs (current as of 2025-11-04)
- AI tool documentation (ChatGPT, Claude Code, Gemini CLI) — tool APIs stable but interfaces may change

**Version Numbers Verified**:
- Python: References "3.12+" correctly (constitution specifies 3.13+; chapter should update to 3.13+)
- SpecifyPlus: No version pinning (appropriate for methodology chapter)

---

## Recommendation

**Status: REVISE & RESUBMIT**

### Justification

The chapter demonstrates **strong pedagogical design and constitutional alignment** with excellent use of the Spec-Kit Plus methodology as the core teaching tool. Content through the existing sections is well-conceived, well-paced, and follows best practices for technical education.

However, **critical blockers must be fixed before publication**:

1. **Lesson 3 is incomplete** (ends abruptly at line 143, missing ~50% of expected content including "Try With AI" section)
2. **Lesson 2 violates closure policy** (ends with "What's Next" instead of required "Try With AI" section)
3. **Docosaurus frontmatter incomplete** (all lesson files missing `sidebar_position` field required by output-styles)
4. **Typo in Lesson 1** (line 218: "methadology" → "methodology")

These are **localized, fixable issues** — the underlying content quality is high, and the chapter structure is sound. Once these issues are resolved, the chapter will be publication-ready with only optional polish recommendations remaining.

---

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Critical Issues (blocking publication)

1. **Complete Lesson 3** (`03-building-specs-with-sp-specify.md`)
   - Add "Try With AI" section (lines 144-194 approximately)
   - Model on Lesson 1 pattern (lines 195-238): tool selection, duration, concrete prompts, expected outcomes
   - Focus prompts on: Running `/sp.specify`, interpreting feedback, using `/sp.clarify` for gaps, iteration cycle
   - Estimated effort: 30 minutes

2. **Replace Lesson 2 Closure** (`02-complete-constitution.md`)
   - Remove "## What's Next" section (lines 160-171)
   - Replace with "## Try With AI" section (add ~40-50 lines)
   - Include prompts showing: `/sp.constitution` command, customizing constitution, reviewing output
   - Expected outcomes: understanding of how constitution guides all future features
   - Estimated effort: 30 minutes

3. **Add `sidebar_position` to All Lesson Files**
   - Modify YAML frontmatter in all 6 lesson files:
     - `01-specifyplus-structure.md`: add `sidebar_position: 1` after `title:`
     - `02-complete-constitution.md`: add `sidebar_position: 2`
     - `03-building-specs-with-sp-specify.md`: add `sidebar_position: 3`
     - `04-planning-sp-plan.md`: add `sidebar_position: 4`
     - `05-decomposing-tasks-sp-tasks.md`: add `sidebar_position: 5`
     - `06-implementation-sp-implement.md`: add `sidebar_position: 6`
   - Estimated effort: 15 minutes

4. **Fix Typo in Lesson 1**
   - Line 218: "methadology" → "methodology"
   - Location: `01-specifyplus-structure.md` line 218 in "Try With AI" section
   - Estimated effort: 2 minutes

### Priority 2: Fix Major Issues (recommended before publication)

5. **Fix README.md Numbering** (`README.md`)
   - Renumber learning objectives from 1-11 (currently 3-13)
   - Rename file from `README.md` to `readme.md` (per output-styles convention)
   - Estimated effort: 5 minutes

### Priority 3: Verification (before resubmission)

6. **Verify All Fixes**
   - Run through each "Try With AI" section to ensure prompts are concrete and actionable
   - Check Docosaurus build: `docusaurus build` to ensure sidebar renders lessons in correct order
   - Verify no new typos introduced during edits
   - Spot-check that lesson closures follow pattern: engaging prompts → clear expected outcomes
   - Estimated effort: 30 minutes

### Resubmission Checkpoint

After completing steps 1-6, resubmit chapter for **spot-check validation** (not full re-review). Validator will:
- Verify critical issues resolved
- Confirm no regressions introduced
- Spot-check new "Try With AI" content for quality
- Check sidebar rendering in Docosaurus
- Approve for publication or flag remaining issues

**Estimated time to fix all issues: 2-3 hours**
**Estimated time for spot-check validation: 30 minutes**

The methodology teaching is sound, the running example is effective, and the hands-on approach (SpecifyPlus commands with "Try With AI" prompts) is exactly what constitution demands.

**Publication is blocked by critical issues**, but these are **straightforward to fix** and do not reflect content quality problems. Once the four critical issues are resolved (incomplete lesson 3, lesson 2 closure policy violation, missing sidebar_position frontmatter, typo), the chapter will be ready for publication.

**Recommendation: REVISE & RESUBMIT with focus on completing lessons 2-3 closures and adding Docosaurus frontmatter.**
