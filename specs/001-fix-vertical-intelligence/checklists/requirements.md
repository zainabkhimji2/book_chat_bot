# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Vertical Intelligence Core Misalignment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All quality criteria met

### Detailed Analysis

**Content Quality Assessment**:
- Specification maintains focus on WHAT needs to be fixed (misalignment) and WHY (contradictory outputs), not HOW to implement
- Business value clearly articulated: unblock content creation workflow, enable authors to generate correct outputs
- Written for project stakeholders (authors, AI collaborators, contributors) without assuming technical implementation knowledge
- All mandatory sections complete: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

**Requirement Completeness Assessment**:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are definitive based on diagnostic analysis
- Every functional requirement is verifiable:
  - FR-001: Can verify constitution has "Current Reality" vs "Future State" sections
  - FR-005: Can verify output-styles/chapters.md shows correct structure
  - FR-013: Can verify PROJECT-STRUCTURE-REALITY.md exists with required content
- Success criteria are measurable and observable:
  - SC-001: Can test chapter-planner → lesson-writer workflow for contradictions
  - SC-002: Can generate test content and verify structure matches without manual edits
  - SC-003: Can run validation script and check for zero reported misalignments
- All 5 user stories have acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases identified and addressed (content created before fix, existing chapter migration, validation gaps)
- Scope explicitly bounded with "Out of Scope" section (no v3.0 feature implementation, no content rewrites)
- Dependencies and assumptions documented separately

**Feature Readiness Assessment**:
- Each of 18 functional requirements mapped to verification method in acceptance scenarios
- User stories prioritized (P1, P2, P3) with independent test descriptions
- Success criteria define observable outcomes without specifying technical solutions:
  - "100% consistency between subagent outputs" not "update chapter-planner.md lines 45-67"
  - "Generated content matches actual book structure" not "use lowercase readme.md filename"
- Zero implementation leakage - specification describes problem and desired outcomes, not solution approach

### Notes

Specification is ready for `/sp.plan` command. No clarifications needed - all requirements grounded in diagnostic analysis already performed.

Key strength: Specification addresses root cause (layer misalignment) rather than symptoms (individual contradictions), enabling systematic fix rather than piecemeal patching.

Implementation priority: P1 user stories (US-1, US-4) enable immediate workflow unblocking; P2 stories (US-2, US-3) prevent future confusion; P3 story (US-5) ensures long-term maintainability.
