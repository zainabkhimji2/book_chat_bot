# Tasks: Chapter 18 - Lists, Tuples, and Dictionary

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-part-4-chapter-18/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (11 lessons), spec.md (4 user stories with priorities)

**Tests**: Not requested in specification - focus on content creation and validation

**Organization**: Tasks organized by user story to enable independent lesson implementation

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different lesson files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Chapter content: `book-source/docs/04-Part-4-Python-Fundamentals/18-lists-tuples-dictionary/`
- Lesson files: `01-lesson-1.md`, `02-lesson-2.md`, etc.
- Supporting files: `README.md`, `_category_.json`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: None (no blocking dependencies)
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: Depend on Setup completion
  - US1 (Lessons 1, 10): Can start after Setup
  - US2 (Lessons 2-4, 7-8): Can start after Setup (independent of US1)
  - US3 (Lessons 5, 9): Can start after Setup (Lesson 5 requires Ch 17 for loops knowledge)
  - US4 (Lessons 6, 11): Lesson 11 depends on Lessons 1-10 completion
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all 11 lessons complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: Independent - can implement Lessons 1, 10 immediately after Setup
- **US2 (P2)**: Independent - can implement Lessons 2-4, 7-8 in parallel with US1
- **US3 (P3)**: Lesson 5 independent, Lesson 9 depends on Lesson 8 (dict CRUD prerequisite)
- **US4 (P1)**: Lesson 6 independent, Lesson 11 depends on Lessons 1-10 (capstone integration)

### Within Each Lesson

- Each lesson can be written independently (different files)
- Lesson 11 (Capstone) MUST be written last (requires understanding all prior lessons)
- All lessons follow same structure: YAML frontmatter → Content → "Try With AI" closure

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: All Setup tasks (T001-T003) can run in parallel
- **Phase 3-6**: All lesson tasks marked [P] can run in parallel EXCEPT:
  - Lesson 9 (T012) after Lesson 8 (T010) - dict CRUD prerequisite
  - Lesson 11 (T014) after Lessons 1-10 - capstone integration
- **Phase 7**: All validation tasks (T015-T022) can run in parallel before technical review

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Lists & Dicts Manipulation)

```bash
# Launch all User Story 2 lessons together (independent files):
Task T006: "Write Lesson 2: Lists Part 1 - Creation and Basic Operations in 02-lesson-2.md"
Task T007: "Write Lesson 3: Lists Part 2 - Mutability and Modification in 03-lesson-3.md"
Task T008: "Write Lesson 4: Lists Part 3 - Sorting, Reversing, Advanced Methods in 04-lesson-4.md"
Task T009: "Write Lesson 7: Dictionaries Part 1 - Key-Value Mappings in 07-lesson-7.md"
Task T010: "Write Lesson 8: Dictionaries Part 2 - CRUD Operations in 08-lesson-8.md"

# All 5 lessons can be written in parallel by different agents/team members
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 4 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (none - skip)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T004-T005) - Understanding fundamentals
4. Complete Phase 6: User Story 4 Lesson 6 (T013) - Tuples prerequisite
5. **PAUSE**: At this point, students can understand collections and tuples
6. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T006-T010) - Lists and dicts manipulation
7. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (T011-T012) - Comprehensions
8. Complete Phase 6: User Story 4 Lesson 11 (T014) - Capstone integration
9. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test complete chapter independently
10. Run Phase 7: Polish & validation

### Incremental Delivery (By User Story Priority)

1. Setup → Foundation ready
2. Add US1 (Lessons 1, 10) → Test independently → Foundational understanding validated
3. Add US2 (Lessons 2-4, 7-8) → Test independently → Manipulation skills validated
4. Add US3 (Lessons 5, 9) → Test independently → Transformation skills validated
5. Add US4 (Lessons 6, 11) → Test independently → Integration validated → Chapter complete!

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple lesson-writer agents or team members:

1. Team completes Setup together (T001-T003)
2. Once Setup done:
   - Agent A: Lessons 1, 10 (US1)
   - Agent B: Lessons 2-4 (US2 Lists)
   - Agent C: Lessons 7-8 (US2 Dicts)
   - Agent D: Lessons 5, 6 (US3 & US4)
   - Agent E: Lesson 9 (US3 - after Agent C completes Lesson 8)
3. All agents complete → Agent F writes Lesson 11 (Capstone - requires all prior lessons)
4. Team runs validation together (Phase 7)

## Notes

### General
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each lesson should be independently writable (different .md file)
- Commit after each lesson completion
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently

### Chapter-Specific
- **Cognitive Load**: Strict 7-concept limit per lesson (intermediate A2-B1 tier)
- **Proficiency Progression**: A1 → A2 → A2-B1 → B1 across 11 lessons (non-regressing)
- **Lesson Closure**: ONLY "Try With AI" section (4 prompts, Bloom's progression) - NO summaries, NO "What's Next", NO checklists
- **CoLearning Elements**: Must appear THROUGHOUT lessons (💬 AI Colearning, 🎓 Instructor Commentary, 🚀 CoLearning Challenge, ✨ Teaching Tip)
- **Type Hints**: Modern Python 3.14+ syntax (`list[T]`, `dict[K,V]`, `tuple[T,...]`, `X | None`) - NO legacy `typing.List`
- **AI Partnership**: Position AI as co-reasoning partner (not autocomplete) - students describe intent, AI explores, students validate
- **Constitutional Alignment**: ADR-0008 (11-lesson structure), ADR-0009 (CEFR proficiency metadata), Principle 12 (cognitive load), Principle 13 (graduated teaching)

### Avoid
- Vague tasks ("write good content")
- Same file conflicts (all lessons are separate files)
- Forward references to Ch 20+ (functions, exceptions, file I/O, OOP)
- Cross-story dependencies that break lesson independence
- Adding summaries or checklists after "Try With AI" section (violates closure rules)
