## Task Dependencies & Sequencing

```
Phase 1: Content Structure (Tasks 1.1-1.5)
  ↓
Phase 2: Evidence Verification (Tasks 2.1-2.6) & Content Writing (Tasks 3.1-3.5)
  (can overlap: verification feeds writing)
  ↓
Phase 3: Review & Integration (Tasks 4.1-4.7)
  ↓
Phase 4: Final Polish (Tasks 5.1-5.3)
```

**Critical Path**:
- Tasks 1.1-1.5 → 3.1-3.5 (outlines must complete before writing)
- Tasks 2.1-2.6 → 3.1, 3.3, 3.5 (verifications feed into writing)
- Tasks 3.1-3.5 → 4.1-4.7 (all writing complete before review)
- Tasks 4.1-4.7 → 5.1 (reviews complete before technical reviewer)
- Task 5.1 → 5.2 (if needed) → 5.3

## Effort Estimation & Timeline

**Total Estimated Effort**: 35-40 hours

**Breakdown by Phase**:
- **Phase 1** (Content Structure): 10 hours (Tasks 1.1-1.5)
- **Phase 2** (Evidence & Writing): 16-18 hours (Tasks 2.1-3.5)
- **Phase 3** (Review & Integration): 8-10 hours (Tasks 4.1-4.7)
- **Phase 4** (Final Polish): 5-6 hours (Tasks 5.1-5.3)

**Recommended Timeline** (if 1 person, 20 hrs/week):
- **Week 1**: Phase 1 (10 hours) + Start Phase 2 evidence verification (3 hours)
- **Week 2**: Continue Phase 2 evidence + writing (18 hours)
- **Week 3**: Complete writing + Phase 3 review (12 hours)
- **Week 4**: Phase 4 final polish + technical review (3-4 hours)

**Alternative Parallel** (if resources available):
- **Person A**: Phase 1 outlines + Phase 3 review (coordinator role)
- **Person B**: Phase 2 evidence verification (researcher)
- **Person C**: Phase 2 content writing (writer)
- **Shared**: Phase 4 final polish + technical review

## Notes for Lesson-Writer

1. **Tone**: Professional, conversational, engaging. Address readers as peers. Avoid condescension; assume no prior knowledge.

2. **Pacing**: Aim for 6-9 minutes per section. Variety helps: narrative, examples, tables, sidebars, reflection prompts.

3. **Examples**: Real and specific. Names, numbers, outcomes. No abstract frameworks without grounding.

4. **Sidebars**: Skeptic's corners should feel like reader's actual objections, not strawman arguments. Respond with evidence, not dismissal.

5. **Forward Bridges**: Each section should close with "Now that we understand X, the next question is Y..." style transition.

6. **Reflection Prompts**: Open-ended questions that invite self-reflection. Avoid yes/no questions.

7. **Accessibility**: If technical term appears, define it in simple language. Examples are clearer than definitions.

8. **References to Spec-Driven Development**: Keep brief in Section 2. Full formalization comes in Part 5. This is overview.

9. **References to DORA**: Position as external validation of practices, not lesson-writer opinion. Cite the research.

10. **Citations**: Every statistic, benchmark, leadership quote needs source. Format consistently.
