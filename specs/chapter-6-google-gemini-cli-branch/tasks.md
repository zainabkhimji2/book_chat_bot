## Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: Content Too Comprehensive (Lesson 5 especially)

**Probability**: High | **Impact**: High

**Mitigation**:
- Mark Lesson 5 as "Advanced: Optional for power users"
- Core mastery in Lessons 1-4 fits 60-90 min target
- Lesson 5 provides depth for those who want it
- Clear signposting: "Ready to go deeper?" before Lesson 5

---

### Risk 2: Outdated Tool Versions During Development

**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:
- Flag all version numbers with dates
- Include "Check for latest" instructions
- Add "Try With AI: Check current Gemini CLI version" prompts
- Schedule quarterly content review

---

### Risk 3: MCP Server Stability/Changes

**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:
- Provide 3 MCP examples (Playwright, Context7, GitHub)
- If one breaks, others remain valid
- Include troubleshooting guide
- Document "MCP servers may change; core principles remain"

---

### Risk 4: Student Overwhelm (5 lessons in 1 chapter)

**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Low

**Mitigation**:
- Progressive complexity: A2 → A2 → A2 → B1 → B1
- Each lesson standalone
- Clear prerequisites between lessons
- Exercises bite-sized (5-12 minutes each)
- "Try With AI" summarizes key concepts

---

### Risk 5: Time Estimation Inaccuracy

**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:
- Build 30% contingency buffer (183-242 hours)
- Validate exercise times during implementation
- Adjust if lessons 2-3 take longer than estimated
- Document actual times for future reference

---

2. **Phase 3: Validation** (technical-reviewer subagent)
   - Verify all 35 FRs covered
   - Code examples tested
   - Exercises validated
   - "Try With AI" prompts working

3. **Phase 4: Integration** (Human final review)
   - Narrative flow across lessons
   - Cross-chapter references working
   - Formatting and style consistent
   - Chapter ready for Docusaurus build

4. **Phase 5: Publication**
