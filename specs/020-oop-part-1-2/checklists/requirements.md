# Specification Quality Checklist: OOP Part I & II (Chapters 24-25)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-09
**Features**:
- [Chapter 24 Spec](../spec-chapter-24.md)
- [Chapter 25 Spec](../spec-chapter-25.md)

## Content Quality

### Chapter 24 (OOP Part I)
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Educational content focused on concepts
- [x] Focused on student value and learning needs
- [x] Written for learners (conversational, not documentation)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed (Evals, Topic Summary, Learning Objectives, User Scenarios, Requirements, Content Outline, Code Examples, Acceptance Criteria, Success Criteria)

### Chapter 25 (OOP Part II)
- [x] No implementation details - Educational content focused on advanced patterns
- [x] Focused on student value and learning needs
- [x] Written for learners (conversational, not documentation)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

### Chapter 24 (OOP Part I)
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All design decisions made (Game Character System, ABC brief intro, 5 lessons)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous (FR-001 through FR-012 all specific)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (12 criteria with specific percentages and metrics)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on learning outcomes, not tools)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined (4 learning journeys with given-when-then)
- [x] Edge cases are identified (attribute access, class vs instance confusion, property decorators)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (Out of Scope section lists Chapter 25 topics explicitly)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (Prerequisites, Assumptions sections)

### Chapter 25 (OOP Part II)
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All design decisions made (4 design patterns selected, 5 lessons)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous (FR-001 through FR-012 all specific)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (12 criteria with specific percentages)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (learning outcomes focused)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios defined (5 learning journeys)
- [x] Edge cases identified (diamond inheritance, circular imports, pattern selection)
- [x] Scope clearly bounded (Out of Scope: metaclasses, dataclasses, Pydantic, async)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

### Chapter 24 (OOP Part I)
- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (FR mapped to Acceptance Criteria section)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (4 learning journeys from fundamentals to capstone)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (12 SC aligned with 12 EVAL)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification (Python 3.14+ mentioned as target, not implementation constraint)

### Chapter 25 (OOP Part II)
- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (5 learning journeys covering all advanced topics)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes (12 SC aligned with 14 EVAL)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## AI-Native CoLearning Pedagogy Compliance

### Chapter 24 (OOP Part I)
- [x] Success Evals defined BEFORE specification (EVAL-001 through EVAL-012 in first section)
- [x] 💬🎓🚀✨ CoLearning elements specified in Content Outline for all lessons
- [x] "Try With AI" closure pattern mandated in requirements (FR-010, Acceptance Criteria)
- [x] Part 4 appropriate language ("describe intent" NOT "write specifications") - specified in multiple sections
- [x] Conversational tone requirements specified
- [x] AI partnership emphasized (FR-009, Content Outline examples)
- [x] Pedagogical ordering compliance specified (FR-011, Acceptance Criteria)

### Chapter 25 (OOP Part II)
- [x] Success Evals defined BEFORE specification (EVAL-001 through EVAL-014)
- [x] CoLearning elements specified throughout Content Outline
- [x] "Try With AI" closure pattern mandated (FR-011)
- [x] Part 4 language appropriate (framing section in Outline)
- [x] Conversational tone requirements specified
- [x] AI partnership emphasized
- [x] Pedagogical ordering compliance specified (FR-012)

## Cross-Chapter Consistency

- [x] Chapter 24 scope excludes what Chapter 25 will cover (inheritance patterns, polymorphism, MRO, composition, special methods, design patterns)
- [x] Chapter 25 prerequisites explicitly include Chapter 24
- [x] No overlap in functional requirements between chapters
- [x] ABC introduction split correctly (Ch24: brief intro, Ch25: deep dive with polymorphism)
- [x] Complexity tiers consistent (both B1-B2, max 10 concepts/lesson)
- [x] CEFR levels consistent (B1-B2 for both)
- [x] Lesson counts reasonable (Ch24: 5 lessons, Ch25: 5 lessons)
- [x] Capstone projects distinct (Ch24: Game Character System, Ch25: Design Patterns)

## Notes

**Validation Status**: ✅ ALL ITEMS PASS

**Key Strengths**:
1. Both specifications follow evals-first approach (Success Evals defined before other sections)
2. Clear separation of concerns between Part I (foundations) and Part II (advanced patterns)
3. AI-Native CoLearning pedagogy deeply integrated (not bolted on)
4. Measurable success criteria aligned with evals
5. Comprehensive acceptance scenarios using given-when-then format
6. Clear scope boundaries prevent overlap
7. Pedagogical requirements (CoLearning elements, Try With AI closure, ordering compliance) are explicit

**Readiness**: Both specifications are ready for `/sp.plan` phase. No clarifications needed.

**Next Steps**:
1. Proceed to Phase 2: Planning (invoke `/sp.plan` for both chapters)
2. chapter-planner will use skills-proficiency-mapper to add CEFR proficiency metadata
3. Plan validation will include ADR suggestions for significant decisions
