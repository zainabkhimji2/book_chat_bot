## Topic Summary

**Object-Oriented Programming Part I** introduces students to the foundational concepts of OOP in Python: classes, objects, encapsulation, and methods. This chapter teaches students to think in terms of real-world entities modeled as objects with attributes (data) and methods (behavior).

In AI-native development, OOP is essential because AI agents themselves are objects. Understanding how to design classes, encapsulate data, and define methods prepares students to build agentic systems where each agent is a well-designed object with clear responsibilities.

**Why this matters**: Professional AI applications are built using OOP principles. Whether creating chatbot agents, data processing pipelines, or multi-agent systems, students need to model complex systems as interacting objects. This chapter lays the foundation for that professional skill.

## Learning Objectives *(aligned with evals)*

By the end of Chapter 24, students will be able to:

1. **LO-001**: Explain the four pillars of OOP (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism) and identify when each is appropriate *(aligns with EVAL-001)*

2. **LO-002**: Create Python classes with constructors (__init__), destructors (__del__), and properly scoped attributes (public, protected, private) *(aligns with EVAL-004, EVAL-005)*

3. **LO-003**: Implement three types of methods (instance methods, class methods with @classmethod, static methods with @staticmethod) and explain when to use each *(aligns with EVAL-002)*

4. **LO-004**: Apply encapsulation principles to protect data and control access using getters/setters and property decorators *(aligns with EVAL-005)*

5. **LO-005**: Build a multi-class object system that models a real-world scenario (Game Character System) using proper OOP design *(aligns with EVAL-006, EVAL-008)*

## User Scenarios & Testing *(for educational content)*

### Learning Journey 1 - Understanding OOP Fundamentals (Priority: P1)

**Scenario**: A beginner Python developer has mastered functions, loops, and data structures (Chapters 12-23) and now needs to organize complex programs using OOP to build maintainable AI applications.

**Why this priority**: OOP fundamentals are the foundation for everything else in Part I. Without understanding classes vs objects and the 4 pillars, students cannot progress.

**Independent Test**: Student can explain OOP pillars and create a simple class after Lesson 1-2.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student has completed Chapters 1-23, **When** they read Lesson 1 (What is OOP?), **Then** they can list the 4 OOP pillars and explain why OOP exists
2. **Given** student understands OOP concept, **When** they complete Lesson 2 (Classes and Objects), **Then** they can create a class with __init__ and create instances
3. **Given** student has created basic classes, **When** they ask AI "Why do we use self?", **Then** AI explains instance reference pattern

---

### Learning Journey 2 - Mastering Constructors and Attributes (Priority: P2)

**Scenario**: Student needs to initialize objects with specific data and manage attribute visibility (public/protected/private) to build robust classes.

**Why this priority**: Proper initialization and attribute management are essential for professional code. This builds on Journey 1 foundations.

**Independent Test**: Student can create a class with parameterized constructor and control attribute access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student knows basic classes, **When** they learn constructors (Lesson 3), **Then** they can create classes with parameterized __init__ methods
2. **Given** student understands constructors, **When** they learn class vs instance attributes, **Then** they can identify which attributes to make class-level vs instance-level
3. **Given** student manages attributes, **When** they use protected (_) and private (__) naming, **Then** they can explain when to use each

---

### Learning Journey 3 - Implementing Encapsulation and Methods (Priority: P3)

**Scenario**: Student needs to organize behavior into methods, control access to data, and use different method types (@classmethod, @staticmethod) appropriately.

**Why this priority**: Builds on Journeys 1-2 to create fully functional, encapsulated classes.

**Independent Test**: Student can create a class with all three method types and proper encapsulation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student has built classes with attributes, **When** they learn instance methods (Lesson 4), **Then** they can add behavior to objects
2. **Given** student uses instance methods, **When** they learn @classmethod and @staticmethod, **Then** they can choose the appropriate method type for different scenarios
3. **Given** student has all method types, **When** they apply encapsulation, **Then** they can protect data using getters/setters and property decorators

---

### Learning Journey 4 - Building Real-World Object Systems (Priority: P4)

**Scenario**: Student applies all OOP Part I concepts to build a Game Character System with multiple interacting classes (Player, Enemy, Inventory, Actions).

**Why this priority**: Synthesis of all prior learning into a complete, testable system.

**Independent Test**: Student completes capstone project successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student has learned all concepts (Lessons 1-4), **When** they start the capstone (Lesson 5), **Then** they can design a multi-class system
2. **Given** student designs the system, **When** they implement Player and Enemy classes, **Then** classes interact correctly (combat, health management)
3. **Given** student implements core classes, **When** they add Inventory and Actions, **Then** the complete system models game mechanics using proper OOP

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a student tries to access a private attribute directly? *(Should raise AttributeError or demonstrate name mangling)*
- How does a student handle cases where class methods need to create instances? *(Teach factory pattern basics)*
- What if a student confuses class attributes with instance attributes and modifies the wrong one? *(Teach debugging with __dict__ inspection)*
- How does @property decorator differ from regular getter methods? *(Show both approaches, explain when each is preferred)*

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

## Content Outline

### Section 1: OOP Fundamentals - Why Objects Matter

**Concepts to Cover** (5 concepts):
1. What is OOP? (paradigm shift from procedural to object-oriented)
2. Why use OOP? (Modularity, Reusability, Maintainability, Scalability)
3. The 4 Pillars Overview (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
4. Real-world modeling (mapping entities to classes)
5. OOP in AI-native development (agents as objects)

**Lesson 1**: What is OOP? Why OOP?
- 💬 AI Colearning Prompt: "Ask your AI: Why did Python adopt OOP when it could have stayed purely procedural?"
- 🎓 Instructor Commentary: "In AI-driven development, OOP isn't about memorizing syntax—it's about thinking in systems of interacting entities"
- 🚀 CoLearning Challenge: "Ask your AI Co-Teacher: Generate a simple class that models a thermometer. Explain why we'd use a class instead of just functions."
- ✨ Teaching Tip: "Use Claude Code to explore OOP history: 'How did OOP evolve from Simula to Python?'"

---

### Section 2: Classes, Objects, and Construction

**Concepts to Cover** (7 concepts):
1. Class definition syntax (class keyword, naming conventions)
2. __init__ constructor method
3. self keyword (instance reference)
4. Creating objects (instantiation)
5. Parameterized vs default constructors
6. __del__ destructor (cleanup)
7. Class vs instance attributes (__dict__ inspection)

**Lesson 2**: Classes and Objects Basics
- Teaching pattern: What it is → Code → Try → Why it matters
- 💬 AI Colearning Prompt: "Ask your AI: What happens in memory when we create an object?"
- 🚀 CoLearning Challenge: "Generate a Vehicle class with brand, model, year. Then explain the difference between the class and an instance."

**Lesson 3**: Constructors, Destructors, and Attributes
- Parameterized constructors with type hints
- When to use __del__ (file handles, connections)
- Class attributes shared across instances
- Instance attributes unique to each object
- 💬 AI Colearning Prompt: "Explain why modifying a class attribute through an instance creates a new instance attribute"

---

### Section 3: Encapsulation and Methods

**Concepts to Cover** (8 concepts):
1. Public attributes (no prefix)
2. Protected attributes (_single_underscore convention)
3. Private attributes (__double_underscore name mangling)
4. Instance methods (operate on self)
5. @classmethod decorator (operate on cls)
6. @staticmethod decorator (utility functions)
7. @property decorator (getters)
8. @property.setter (setters)

**Lesson 4**: Encapsulation and Method Types
- Access control patterns
- When to use each method type
- Property decorators vs manual getters/setters
- 💬 AI Colearning Prompt: "Why does Python use naming conventions (_name, __name) instead of true access modifiers like private/public keywords?"
- 🚀 CoLearning Challenge: "Create a BankAccount class with private __balance. Use @property to control access and validate withdrawals."

---

### Section 4: Abstract Base Classes (Brief Introduction)

**Concepts to Cover** (3 concepts):
1. What is abstraction? (hiding complexity, showing only essentials)
2. ABC module (abc.ABC, @abstractmethod)
3. Why abstract classes exist (enforce implementation contracts)

**Note**: This is a BRIEF introduction only. Deep dive with polymorphism patterns in Chapter 25.

**In Lesson 4**: Add subsection after methods:
- Show simple ABC example (Shape with area() abstract method)
- Explain "contract" concept (all shapes MUST implement area())
- 💬 AI Colearning Prompt: "Ask your AI: Why would we create a class we can't instantiate? What problem does ABC solve?"

---

### Section 5: Capstone - Game Character System

**Lesson 5**: Building a Game Character System

**Classes to Build**:
1. **Character** (base class with health, name, level)
2. **Player** (extends Character with inventory, experience)
3. **Enemy** (extends Character with loot, difficulty)
4. **Inventory** (manages items, weight limits)
5. **Action** (attack, defend, use_item methods)

**Concepts Applied**:
- Multiple interacting classes
- Encapsulation (private health with getter/setter)
- Class methods (factory for creating character types)
- Static methods (damage calculations)
- Property decorators (computed attributes like is_alive)

**🚀 CoLearning Challenge**:
"Ask your AI to design the class structure for a turn-based combat system. Then implement it together, explaining each design choice."

---

### Common Mistakes

1. **Confusing class and instance attributes**: Modifying class attribute creates instance shadow
2. **Forgetting self parameter**: Instance methods must have self as first parameter
3. **Accessing private attributes directly**: Use getters or property decorators
4. **Overusing @staticmethod**: If it doesn't need self or cls, maybe it shouldn't be in the class
5. **Skipping type hints**: Modern Python requires type hints for clarity and AI collaboration

---

### AI Exercise Integration

Throughout all lessons, students use Claude Code or Gemini CLI to:
- Explore concepts through dialogue
- Generate code from descriptions
- Validate understanding through questions
- Debug errors with AI assistance
- Extend examples beyond chapter scope

**Framing** (Part 4 appropriate):
- ✅ "Describe what your class should do..."
- ✅ "Ask your AI to explain..."
- ✅ "Validate your code works by testing..."
- ❌ NO "Write a specification" (that's Part 5)
- ❌ NO "Specification-Driven Development" (formal SDD is Chapters 30+)
