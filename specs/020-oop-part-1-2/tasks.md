## Parallel Execution Opportunities

### Phase 3 (Ch24 LJ1):
- T010-T020 (Lesson 1) and T021-T034 (Lesson 2) can be written in parallel by different authors
- T035-T036 (testing & validation) must be sequential after both lessons complete

### Phase 6 (Ch24 Capstone):
- T082-T084 (Character class), T085-T087 (Player class), T088-T089 (Enemy class), T090-T091 (Combat class) can be written in parallel
- T092-T097 (integration & validation) must be sequential

### Phase 12 (Polish):
- T185-T192 (all validation tasks marked [P]) can run in parallel
- T193-T195 (cross-chapter tasks) must be sequential

## Policy Note for Lesson Authors

**Lesson Closure Pattern** (Constitutional Requirement):

Within this chapter, each lesson MUST end with a single final section titled **"Try With AI"** containing 4 prompts with progressive Bloom's levels (Recall → Understand → Apply → Analyze/Synthesize).

**DO NOT include after "Try With AI"**:
- ❌ "Key Takeaways" or "Summary"
- ❌ "What's Next"
- ❌ "Completion Checklist"
- ❌ Any other closure content

**AI Tool Guidance**:
- In Part 4 (these chapters), students use their preferred AI companion tool (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or ChatGPT web)
- Phrase prompts generically: "Ask your AI companion..." or "Use your AI tool..."
- Optionally provide CLI and web variants for complex prompts

**Tasks Status**: ✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION (195 tasks defined)
