## Topic Summary

**Object-Oriented Programming Part II** builds on Chapter 24 foundations to teach advanced OOP patterns: inheritance hierarchies, polymorphism, composition vs inheritance, special methods, and professional design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy).

This chapter transforms students from basic OOP practitioners into professional object-oriented designers. Students learn to evaluate design tradeoffs, recognize when to use inheritance vs composition, and apply battle-tested design patterns from real-world software engineering.

**Why this matters**: Modern AI agent systems are built using these advanced patterns. Multi-agent systems use inheritance for agent types, polymorphism for flexible behavior, and design patterns like Factory (creating agents dynamically) and Observer (event-driven agent communication). This chapter prepares students for professional AI engineering.

## Learning Objectives *(aligned with evals)*

By the end of Chapter 25, students will be able to:

1. **LO-001**: Create inheritance hierarchies using super(), explain Method Resolution Order (MRO), and identify when inheritance is appropriate vs composition *(aligns with EVAL-001, EVAL-002, EVAL-005)*

2. **LO-002**: Implement polymorphic behavior using abstract base classes, duck typing, and method overriding *(aligns with EVAL-003, EVAL-006)*

3. **LO-003**: Design object systems using composition over inheritance when appropriate, and explain the tradeoffs *(aligns with EVAL-001)*

4. **LO-004**: Override special methods (__str__, __repr__, __add__, __len__, __getitem__, etc.) to customize object behavior *(aligns with EVAL-004, EVAL-008)*

5. **LO-005**: Implement 4 design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy) and explain when each is appropriate *(aligns with EVAL-007, EVAL-010)*

6. **LO-006**: Organize OOP code into modules and packages for scalability *(extends Ch24 knowledge)*

## User Scenarios & Testing *(for educational content)*

### Learning Journey 1 - Mastering Inheritance and MRO (Priority: P1)

**Scenario**: Student has built basic classes (Ch24) and now needs to create class hierarchies to model "is-a" relationships and reuse code through inheritance.

**Why this priority**: Inheritance is foundational for polymorphism and design patterns. Without understanding MRO, students cannot debug diamond inheritance or super() calls.

**Independent Test**: Student can create a 3-level inheritance hierarchy with proper super() usage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student understands classes from Ch24, **When** they learn single inheritance (Lesson 1), **Then** they can create parent-child class relationships
2. **Given** student can create single inheritance, **When** they learn super() function, **Then** they can properly call parent methods
3. **Given** student uses super(), **When** they learn MRO, **Then** they can explain which parent method gets called in diamond inheritance
4. **Given** student understands MRO, **When** they use mro() method, **Then** they can inspect and debug inheritance chains

---

### Learning Journey 2 - Implementing Polymorphism (Priority: P2)

**Scenario**: Student needs to write code that works with different object types through a common interface (polymorphism) and understands Python's duck typing philosophy.

**Why this priority**: Polymorphism is the power of OOP. Without it, students miss the main benefit of inheritance and abstract base classes.

**Independent Test**: Student can create polymorphic code that works with multiple class types.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student knows inheritance, **When** they learn method overriding (Lesson 2), **Then** they can create child classes with specialized behavior
2. **Given** student can override methods, **When** they learn abstract base classes deeply, **Then** they can enforce implementation contracts
3. **Given** student uses ABC, **When** they learn duck typing, **Then** they can write polymorphic code without inheritance
4. **Given** student understands polymorphism, **When** they see real AI agent examples, **Then** they recognize polymorphic patterns in production code

---

### Learning Journey 3 - Choosing Composition Over Inheritance (Priority: P3)

**Scenario**: Student needs to decide between inheritance ("is-a") and composition ("has-a") when designing object systems, and organize code into modules.

**Why this priority**: Professional developers prefer composition for flexibility. This journey teaches design judgment.

**Independent Test**: Student can refactor an inheritance-based design to use composition and explain why it's better.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student knows inheritance, **When** they learn composition (Lesson 3), **Then** they can model "has-a" relationships
2. **Given** student can use both patterns, **When** they learn "composition over inheritance" principle, **Then** they can explain tradeoffs
3. **Given** student understands tradeoffs, **When** they see a design problem, **Then** they can choose the appropriate pattern
4. **Given** student builds multi-class systems, **When** they learn modules/packages, **Then** they can organize code into scalable structure

---

### Learning Journey 4 - Customizing Objects with Special Methods (Priority: P4)

**Scenario**: Student needs to make custom objects behave like built-in types (support +, len(), str(), iteration, etc.) using special methods.

**Why this priority**: Special methods make Python objects Pythonic. This is advanced but essential for professional code.

**Independent Test**: Student can implement 5+ special methods to customize object behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student has created classes, **When** they learn __str__ and __repr__ (Lesson 4), **Then** they can control object display
2. **Given** student controls display, **When** they learn operator overloading (__add__, __sub__, etc.), **Then** custom objects work with operators
3. **Given** student can overload operators, **When** they learn container protocols (__len__, __getitem__, __iter__), **Then** objects behave like lists/dicts
4. **Given** student masters special methods, **When** they see Python source code, **Then** they recognize how built-in types work

---

### Learning Journey 5 - Applying Design Patterns (Priority: P5 - Capstone)

**Scenario**: Student applies all OOP Part II knowledge to implement 4 professional design patterns used in real AI systems.

**Why this priority**: Synthesis of all learning. Design patterns are the vocabulary of professional software architecture.

**Independent Test**: Student completes capstone implementing Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Strategy patterns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** student completed Lessons 1-4, **When** they start capstone (Lesson 5), **Then** they can identify which pattern solves which problem
2. **Given** student understands pattern selection, **When** they implement Singleton pattern, **Then** they ensure only one instance exists
3. **Given** student implements Singleton, **When** they implement Factory pattern, **Then** they create objects without specifying exact class
4. **Given** student implements Factory, **When** they implement Observer pattern, **Then** they create event-driven systems
5. **Given** student implements Observer, **When** they implement Strategy pattern, **Then** they can switch algorithms at runtime
6. **Given** student implements all 4 patterns, **When** they integrate them into one system, **Then** they demonstrate professional OOP architecture

- How do you prevent inheritance when you want composition? *(Teach when NOT to use inheritance)*
- What if a subclass doesn't override an abstract method? *(Show TypeError at instantiation)*

---

### Section 5: Design Patterns Capstone

**Lesson 5**: Implementing Design Patterns

**Patterns to Implement**:

1. **Singleton Pattern** (Configuration, Logger, Database Connection)
   - Ensure only one instance exists
   - Thread-safe implementation
   - Use case: Global configuration manager

2. **Factory Pattern** (Agent creation, Object creation)
   - Create objects without specifying exact class
   - Product hierarchy (AbstractProduct, ConcreteProducts)
   - Use case: Creating different agent types dynamically

3. **Observer Pattern** (Event systems, Pub-Sub)
   - One-to-many dependency
   - Subject notifies observers when state changes
   - Use case: Event-driven agent communication

4. **Strategy Pattern** (Algorithm selection)
   - Encapsulate algorithms in separate classes
   - Switch strategies at runtime
   - Use case: Different AI model selection strategies

**Integration Example**: Build an AI Agent System combining all 4 patterns:
- Singleton: AgentManager (single instance)
- Factory: AgentFactory creates different agent types
- Observer: Agents observe events and react
- Strategy: Agents use different reasoning strategies

**🚀 CoLearning Challenge**:
"Design a multi-agent system where agents communicate via Observer pattern, are created by Factory, managed by Singleton, and use Strategy for decision-making. Ask AI to help architect this."

---

### Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting super() in __init__**: Child class doesn't call parent constructor
2. **Diamond inheritance without understanding MRO**: Unexpected method calls
3. **Overusing inheritance**: Creating deep hierarchies when composition is better
4. **Not implementing all abstract methods**: TypeError at instantiation
5. **Implementing __eq__ without __hash__**: Objects can't be used in sets/dicts
6. **Circular imports in modules**: Poor package organization

---

### AI Exercise Integration

Throughout all lessons, students use Claude Code or Gemini CLI to:
- Explore advanced patterns through AI dialogue
- Generate design pattern implementations
- Refactor inheritance to composition
- Debug MRO issues
- Visualize class hierarchies

**Framing** (Part 4 appropriate):
- ✅ "Describe the agent system you want to build..."
- ✅ "Ask your AI which pattern fits this problem..."
- ✅ "Validate your MRO by testing with mro() method..."
- ❌ NO "Write formal specifications" (that's Part 5)
