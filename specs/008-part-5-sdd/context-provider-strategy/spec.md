# Feature Specification: Context Architecture for AI Agents in SDD

**Feature ID**: context-provider-strategy
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Date**: 2025-11-01

---

## Intent

Add a **new lesson to Chapter 32** (Lesson 6) that teaches how to architect AI agents to stay current with evolving APIs and libraries. This addresses the gap between agent knowledge cutoffs and real-world API changes.

**Problem Solved**:
- Developers write specs saying "use latest API" but agents have knowledge cutoffs
- APIs evolve faster than agent knowledge
- Generated code can be stale on day 1

**Solution**:
- Teach context architecture as a SPECIFICATION DECISION
- Present three major strategies: Context7, Tessel Registry, Hybrid approaches
- Provide decision framework for choosing the right approach
- Integrate into capstone project planning

---

## Scope

### In Scope
✅ Context7 (MCP-based live documentation)
✅ Tessel Registry (spec-driven library discovery)
✅ Hybrid approaches (RAG, embedded, memory, version pinning)
✅ Decision matrix for choosing strategy
✅ Real example: Stripe integration with Context7
✅ Integration into capstone project

### Out of Scope
❌ Implementation details of Context7 or Tessel (reference only)
❌ Building custom RAG systems (overview only)
❌ Comparing other context providers not mentioned
❌ Deep dive into MCP protocol (already taught in Part 2)

---

## Key Concepts

1. **Knowledge Cutoff Problem**
   - Agent knowledge is frozen at training date
   - APIs evolve continuously after that date
   - Specs say "latest" but agents can't deliver "latest"

2. **Context Architecture**
   - Strategic decision about how agents access current knowledge
   - Part of specification, not implementation detail
   - Affects code quality, maintenance, and correctness

3. **Three Strategies**
   - Context7: Live documentation via MCP
   - Tessel: Spec-driven machine-readable specs
   - Hybrid: RAG, embedded, memory, versioning

4. **Decision Framework**
   - How often does API change?
   - How critical is correctness?
   - Is library Tessel-enabled?
   - Do you have offline requirements?
   - What's your infrastructure appetite?

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this lesson, students will:

1. **Understand** why agent knowledge cutoffs matter for specifications
2. **Identify** when context architecture is a critical design decision
3. **Evaluate** three major strategies for keeping agents current
4. **Choose** appropriate context architecture for their capstone
5. **Implement** context strategy reference in their capstone specification

## Content Structure

### Part 1: The Problem (15 minutes)
- Real scenario: Stripe integration failing because API changed
- Why this is a specification problem
- How context architecture is part of SDD

### Part 2: Strategy 1 - Context7 (45 minutes)
- What is Context7 (MCP-based live docs)
- How it works with Claude Code
- Real spec example with Context7 reference
- When to use, when not to use
- Hands-on: Write Stripe spec using Context7

### Part 3: Strategy 2 - Tessel Registry (45 minutes)
- What is Tessel (from Chapter 30 recap)
- Machine-readable library specs
- How code generators use Tessel specs
- When to use (safety-critical systems)
- Reflection: Tessel future promise

### Part 4: Strategy 3 - Hybrid Approaches (45 minutes)
- Option A: Embedded documentation
- Option B: RAG (vector search)
- Option C: Agent memory
- Option D: Version pinning
- Trade-offs for each approach

### Part 5: Decision Framework (30 minutes)
- Matrix: Which strategy for which scenario
- Questions to ask your context
- Exercise: Assess your capstone's needs
- Commitment: Choose strategy for capstone

## Connection to Constitution

**Principles this teaches**:
1. **Principle 1: Specifications Precede Implementation**
   - Context architecture IS a specification decision

2. **Principle 3: Validation-First Safety**
   - Validating that agents have current knowledge

3. **Principle 6: AI as Co-Reasoning Partner**
   - Designing the agent's knowledge environment

4. **Principle 14: Planning-First Development**
   - Planning includes: How will agents stay current?

## Integration Points

**Prerequisites**:
- Chapter 30: Understanding SDD (spec-as-source concept)
- Chapter 31: Hands-on spec writing
- Chapter 32, Lessons 1-5: Team scaling (context for production systems)
- Part 2, Lesson 5: MCP servers (context for understanding Context7)

**Follows**:
- Lesson 5: SDD In the Wild (real companies use specs)

**Precedes**:
- Lesson 7: Write Professional Commitment (incorporate context strategy)
- Capstone Part 1: Decompose Spec (with context architecture included)

## Deliverables

✅ **Lesson file**: `06-how-agents-stay-current-context-architecture-for-living-specs.md`
✅ **Chapter 32 README updated**: New lesson documented
✅ **Part 5 README updated**: Time estimates and topic list
✅ **Part 5 total**: 51-64 hours (updated from 45-59)

---

## Teaching Method

**AI-Native Pedagogy**:
- Problem-centered (knowledge cutoff failing specs)
- Discovery through dialogue (ask your companion questions)
- Real examples (Stripe, FastAPI)
- Decision-making emphasis (choose YOUR approach)
- Integration into capstone (apply immediately)

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Students understand why context architecture matters
✅ Students can identify when it's a critical decision
✅ Students can compare and contrast three strategies
✅ Students can choose appropriate approach for their context
✅ Students incorporate context strategy into capstone plan
✅ Lesson integrates seamlessly before capstone

## Questions Answered

**Q: Why before capstone?**
A: Students need this architectural knowledge to design their capstone specifications thoughtfully. They should make explicit choices about context architecture in Lesson 6, then implement them in the capstone.

**Q: Why is this part of SDD?**
A: Specifications are only useful if agents can act on them with current knowledge. Context architecture is the mechanism that keeps that promise.

**Q: How is this different from Part 2 (MCP)?**
A: Part 2 teaches HOW to use MCP servers. This lesson teaches WHY context architecture matters and HOW to choose between strategies.

**Q: Will this be relevant in 2026+?**
A: Yes. As APIs evolve and agents improve, the question of "how do agents stay current" only becomes more important. This framework will remain relevant.
