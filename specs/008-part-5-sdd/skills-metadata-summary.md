# Skills Metadata Implementation Summary

## Objective Complete ✅

**User Request**: "Now using international standards in each lesson I want you to add in the yaml metadata at top the skills their level and objectives. So we have metadata that student's won't see and it's the skill map. It will be in part and chapter and lessons"

**Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Skills Metadata Schema

Added to YAML frontmatter of all 27 lessons:

```yaml
skills:
  - name: "Skill Name"
    proficiency: "A1|A2|B1|B2|C1|C2"  # International standard levels
    category: "Technical|Conceptual|Soft"

learning_objectives:
  - "Measurable outcome (Level)"
  - "Another outcome (Level)"
```

### 2. Proficiency Scale (International Standards)

Following CEFR-inspired framework:

- **A1**: Foundation (recognize, understand)
- **A2**: Basic (apply in simple contexts)
- **B1**: Intermediate (apply to real problems)
- **B2**: Advanced (solve complex problems)
- **C1**: Proficient (expert independent work)
- **C2**: Expert (thought leadership)

### 3. Skill Categories

- **Technical** (code, tools, systems): ~30 skills
- **Conceptual** (ideas, frameworks, theory): ~32 skills
- **Soft** (communication, reflection, collaboration): ~28 skills

- Proficiency increases gradually
- Clear scaffolding from foundation to intermediate

### 3. Balanced Coverage
- Technical skills heavily weighted in Chapter 31 (practice)
- Conceptual skills heavily weighted in Chapters 30 & 32 (theory & scaling)
- Soft skills progressively introduced in Chapter 32

### 4. Assessment-Ready
- Each skill tied to measurable learning objective
- Objectives include proficiency level
- Registry enables competency tracking
