## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all lesson implementation
- **Lessons 1-2 (Phases 3-4)**: Depend on Foundational - can run in parallel (A2 level)
- **Lesson 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Lessons 1-2 (builds on validation and time concepts)
- **Lessons 4-5 (Phases 6-7)**: Depend on Lesson 3 - can run in parallel (both use datetime objects)
- **Lesson 6 Capstone (Phase 8)**: Depends on Lessons 1-5 (integration of all concepts)
- **Cross-Lesson Validation (Phase 9)**: Depends on Lessons 1-6 complete
- **Technical Review (Phase 10)**: Depends on Cross-Lesson Validation
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on Technical Review PASS

### Lesson Dependencies

- **Lesson 1**: Can start after Foundational (no dependencies on other lessons)
- **Lesson 2**: Can start after Foundational (parallel with Lesson 1)
- **Lesson 3**: Depends on Lessons 1-2 (uses validation patterns from L1, time concepts from L2)
- **Lesson 4**: Depends on Lesson 3 (uses datetime objects)
- **Lesson 5**: Depends on Lesson 3 (uses datetime concepts, parallel with Lesson 4)
- **Lesson 6**: Depends on Lessons 1-5 (integration capstone)

### Within Each Lesson

- Introduction before code examples
- Code examples before AI CoLearning elements (elements reference examples)
- All content before "Try With AI" closure
- YAML frontmatter at file start
- Testing after all content written

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel
- **Phase 3 (Lesson 1)**: T011-T012 can start together (intro + sections)
- **Phase 4 (Lesson 2)**: T024-T025 can start together
- **Phase 5 (Lesson 3)**: T037-T038 can start together
- **Phase 6 (Lesson 4)**: T052-T053 can start together
- **Phase 7 (Lesson 5)**: T066-T067 can start together
- **Phase 8 (Lesson 6)**: T080-T082 can start together
- **Phase 9**: ALL validation tasks (T096-T108) can run in parallel
- **Phase 11**: T114-T117 can run in parallel

**Lessons 1 and 2 can be written in parallel after Foundational phase**
**Lessons 4 and 5 can be written in parallel after Lesson 3**

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Lesson 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (verify Python 3.14 features)
3. Complete Phase 3: Lesson 1 (Math Module Fundamentals)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Review Lesson 1 independently
5. Demo/review with stakeholders

### Incremental Delivery (Lesson by Lesson)

1. Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add Lesson 1 → Review independently → Approve
3. Add Lesson 2 → Review independently → Approve
4. Add Lesson 3 → Review independently → Approve
5. Add Lesson 4 → Review independently → Approve
6. Add Lesson 5 → Review independently → Approve
7. Add Lesson 6 → Review independently → Approve
8. Cross-Lesson Validation → Technical Review → Polish → Publish

Each lesson adds value and can be reviewed independently before proceeding.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With lesson-writer subagent or multiple reviewers:

1. Complete Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational done:
   - Writer A: Lesson 1
   - Writer B: Lesson 2
3. After Lessons 1-2:
   - Single writer: Lesson 3 (depends on 1-2)
4. After Lesson 3:
   - Writer A: Lesson 4
   - Writer B: Lesson 5
5. After Lessons 4-5:
   - Single writer: Lesson 6 (capstone integration)
6. Cross-Lesson Validation + Technical Review

---

## Policy Note for Lesson Authors

**Lesson Closure Pattern**: Within this chapter, each lesson MUST end with a single final section titled "Try With AI" containing exactly 4 progressive prompts (no "Key Takeaways", "Summary", "What's Next", or other sections after).

**AI Tool Selection**: Before AI tools are taught (Parts 1-3), use ChatGPT web in "Try With AI" sections; after tool onboarding (Part 2), instruct learners to use their preferred AI companion tool (Gemini CLI, Claude CLI), optionally providing CLI and web variants.

**For this chapter** (Part 4, Chapter 23): Learners have completed Part 2 tool onboarding, so "Try With AI" sections should reference "your AI companion" (Gemini CLI, Claude CLI, or ChatGPT web).
