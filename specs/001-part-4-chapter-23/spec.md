## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Perform Mathematical Calculations with Validation (Priority: P1)

As a Python learner, I want to perform mathematical calculations (square roots, logarithms, trigonometry, rounding) with proper error handling so I can build applications that validate numeric inputs and prevent domain errors.

**Why this priority**: Mathematical operations are foundational for scientific computing, data analysis, and everyday programming tasks. Students must understand WHEN to use math functions (not memorize all 40+) and how to validate results.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having students write functions that perform calculations with type hints, validate inputs (negative numbers for sqrt, zero for division), and handle domain errors using Python 3.14's enhanced error messages. Delivers immediate value for any numeric computation task.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a need to calculate square root, **When** student uses `math.sqrt()` with positive number, **Then** result is calculated correctly with proper type hints
2. **Given** an invalid input (negative number for sqrt), **When** student attempts calculation, **Then** Python 3.14 provides detailed domain error message that student can interpret with AI assistance
3. **Given** need for mathematical constants, **When** student uses `math.pi`, `math.e`, `math.tau`, **Then** precise values are available for calculations
4. **Given** floating-point results, **When** student uses `round()`, `math.ceil()`, `math.floor()`, **Then** values are rounded appropriately with understanding of differences
5. **Given** special numeric values, **When** student encounters `math.inf` or `math.nan`, **Then** they understand these as validation concepts for edge cases

---

### User Story 2 - Work with Dates and Times Programmatically (Priority: P1)

As a Python learner, I want to create, parse, format, and manipulate dates and times using Python 3.14's datetime module so I can build applications that track events, calculate durations, and display time information correctly.

**Why this priority**: Datetime handling is critical for any real-world application (scheduling, logging, analytics, user interfaces). Python 3.14 introduces NEW `date.strptime()` and `time.strptime()` methods that simplify parsing - students should learn these as PRIMARY approaches.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having students create date/time objects, parse user-provided date strings using Python 3.14's new methods, format output with `strftime()`, and calculate durations with timedelta. Delivers immediate value for scheduling and time-tracking applications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a date string like "2025-11-09", **When** student uses `date.strptime()` (NEW in 3.14), **Then** date object is created correctly with type hints
2. **Given** a time string like "14:30:45", **When** student uses `time.strptime()` (NEW in 3.14), **Then** time object is created correctly
3. **Given** need for current date/time, **When** student uses `datetime.now()`, **Then** current timestamp is captured with optional timezone awareness
4. **Given** two dates, **When** student calculates difference using timedelta, **Then** duration (days, hours, minutes) is computed accurately
5. **Given** a datetime object, **When** student formats it using `strftime()` with format codes, **Then** output matches specified format (e.g., "November 09, 2025" or "2025-11-09 14:30")

---

### User Story 3 - Understand Time Concepts and Epoch (Priority: P2)

As a Python learner, I want to understand how computers measure time (epoch, timestamps, ticks) and use the `time` module so I can work with Unix timestamps and convert between time representations.

**Why this priority**: Understanding epoch (January 1, 1970 UTC) is essential for working with timestamps in APIs, databases, and logs. This is foundational knowledge for professional development but builds on datetime concepts (hence P2, not P1).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having students explain what epoch means, use `time.time()` to get current timestamp, convert timestamps to human-readable format with `time.localtime()` and `time.asctime()`. Delivers value for understanding system logs and API timestamps.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** need to understand time measurement, **When** student explains epoch concept, **Then** they can articulate "seconds since January 1, 1970 UTC" as the reference point
2. **Given** need for current timestamp, **When** student uses `time.time()`, **Then** floating-point seconds since epoch is returned
3. **Given** a timestamp, **When** student converts using `time.localtime()`, **Then** time tuple with year, month, day, hour, minute, second is produced
4. **Given** a time tuple, **When** student formats using `time.asctime()`, **Then** human-readable string like "Sat Nov 09 14:30:00 2025" is generated

---

### User Story 4 - Handle Timezones in Applications (Priority: P2)

As a Python learner, I want to work with timezone-aware datetime objects and convert times between timezones so I can build applications that serve global users correctly.

**Why this priority**: Timezone handling is crucial for global applications but introduces complexity (DST, UTC offsets). Taught after basic datetime concepts (hence P2). Uses Python 3.14's recommended `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` instead of deprecated `utcnow()`.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having students create timezone-aware datetime objects, convert between timezones (e.g., UTC to EST), and handle edge cases (DST transitions) with AI assistance. Delivers value for building international applications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** need for UTC time, **When** student uses `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` (not deprecated `utcnow()`), **Then** timezone-aware datetime object is created
2. **Given** a UTC datetime, **When** student converts to another timezone (e.g., US/Eastern), **Then** offset is applied correctly and local time is displayed
3. **Given** two times in different timezones, **When** student calculates difference, **Then** actual duration is computed accounting for timezone offsets
4. **Given** ambiguous times (DST transitions), **When** student encounters errors, **Then** they can use AI to understand and handle edge cases

---

### User Story 5 - Display Calendars and Advanced Math (Priority: P3)

As a Python learner, I want to generate calendar displays and perform advanced mathematical operations (trigonometry, logarithms) so I can build diverse applications from scheduling interfaces to scientific calculators.

**Why this priority**: Calendar and advanced math are useful but less frequently needed than core datetime/math operations (hence P3). Includes Python 3.14's calendar color highlighting feature and trigonometric functions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having students generate calendar displays with `calendar.month()` (observing color highlighting in terminal), perform trigonometric calculations for angles, and work with logarithms. Delivers value for specialized applications (scheduling UIs, scientific computing).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** need to display a month calendar, **When** student uses `calendar.month(2025, 11)`, **Then** calendar grid is generated with today's date highlighted in color (Python 3.14 terminal feature)
2. **Given** an angle in radians, **When** student calculates `math.sin()`, `math.cos()`, `math.tan()`, **Then** trigonometric values are computed accurately
3. **Given** a number, **When** student calculates `math.log()`, `math.log10()`, **Then** natural and base-10 logarithms are computed with understanding of when to use each
4. **Given** need for factorial, **When** student uses `math.factorial(5)`, **Then** result (120) is computed and student understands combinatorial applications

---

### User Story 6 - Build Practical Time Zone Converter (Capstone) (Priority: P1)

As a Python learner, I want to build a complete Time Zone Converter application that demonstrates all chapter concepts (date parsing, time conversion, formatting, validation) so I can apply AI-Native Learning to a real-world project.

**Why this priority**: Capstone projects are critical for integrating all chapter knowledge into a working application. Time Zone Converter is practical, uses all learned concepts, and demonstrates AI partnership throughout development (hence P1 for pedagogical completeness).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by students building the application with AI assistance, testing with multiple timezone scenarios, validating user input, handling errors gracefully, and demonstrating the working converter. Delivers value as a portfolio piece and practical tool.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user input (date/time string and source timezone), **When** student's app parses using `date.strptime()` or `datetime.strptime()`, **Then** datetime object is created with validation
2. **Given** a datetime in one timezone, **When** student's app converts to target timezone, **Then** correct local time is displayed with offset information
3. **Given** invalid input (malformed date, invalid timezone), **When** user submits, **Then** app provides helpful error messages and recovery options
4. **Given** multiple timezone conversions, **When** student's app displays results, **Then** output is formatted clearly using `strftime()` with user-friendly labels
5. **Given** completed capstone, **When** student explains design choices, **Then** they articulate how AI assisted with planning, implementation, debugging, and validation

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when parsing invalid date strings?** Python 3.14 `date.strptime()` raises `ValueError` with detailed message - students learn to handle with try/except and ask AI to interpret errors
- **How does system handle negative numbers in math.sqrt()?** Raises `ValueError` with Python 3.14's enhanced domain error message - students use AI to understand mathematical constraints
- **What happens during DST transitions?** Ambiguous or non-existent times can occur - students explore with AI to understand fold parameter and timezone complexity
- **How are leap years handled in date arithmetic?** Python's datetime correctly accounts for leap years - students validate with test cases (e.g., February 29, 2024)
- **What happens with very large or very small numbers?** Math operations may produce `math.inf` (infinity) or underflow to zero - students learn these as validation concepts
- **How does calendar.month() detect "today" for color highlighting?** Uses system date - students experiment in terminal to see Python 3.14's color feature

4. Display results in multiple formats (ISO, friendly, timestamp)
5. Handle errors gracefully (invalid dates, unknown timezones, parsing failures)
6. Provide clear user feedback and recovery options
7. Use type hints throughout
8. Demonstrate AI-assisted development (show how AI helped at each stage)

**Code Examples** (1 complete application):
- Full Time Zone Converter with modular functions
- Input validation and error handling
- Multiple output formats
- Optional extensions (batch conversion, calendar view, DST warnings)

**AI CoLearning Elements**:
- 💬 Prompt: "Help me plan the Time Zone Converter architecture—what functions do I need?"
- 🎓 Commentary: "You're not writing this alone. Your AI is your pair programmer: you describe intent, AI suggests implementation, you validate and refine"
- 🚀 Challenge: "Ask AI to help you handle edge cases: 'What if user enters invalid timezone? How do I test DST transitions?'"
- ✨ Tip: "Use AI for the whole workflow: planning → implementation → debugging → validation → documentation"

**Try With AI** (4 prompts, progressive):
1. Recall: "List all chapter concepts used in this capstone (math, time, datetime, calendar)"
2. Understand: "Explain your design choices—why did you structure functions this way?"
3. Apply: "Add a feature that converts multiple timezones at once (e.g., show current time in NYC, London, Tokyo)"
4. Synthesize: "Reflect on your AI partnership: How did AI help you learn vs just complete the project?"

## Implementation Notes *(for lesson-writer subagent)*

**Pedagogical Priorities**:
1. **Python 3.14 Native**: Teach `date.strptime()` and `time.strptime()` as PRIMARY methods (not alternatives). Never mention deprecated `utcnow()`.
2. **AI-Native Learning Throughout**: Apply 💬🎓🚀✨ elements THROUGHOUT lessons (not just "Try With AI" at end). Conversational tone, exploration-focused.
3. **Graduated Teaching Pattern**: Book teaches foundational (epoch, what is strptime) → AI companion handles complex (timezone DST edge cases) → AI orchestration at scale (batch timezone conversions).
4. **Cognitive Load Respect**: Max 7 concepts per lesson (A2-B1 intermediate tier). Progressive complexity: A2 → A2-B1 → B1.
5. **Lesson Closure**: ALL lessons end with "Try With AI" ONLY (4 prompts, progressive Bloom's). NO summaries, checklists, or "what's next" after.

**Code Quality Standards**:
- Python 3.14+ syntax with modern type hints (`date`, `datetime`, `float`, `int`, `str`)
- f-strings only (no `.format()` or `%`)
- `X | None` instead of `Optional[X]`
- All datetime code uses modern approaches (no deprecated methods)
- Validate user input before parsing dates or performing math operations
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials

**Context Materials (Ruthlessly Filtered)**:
- ✅ USE: Math functions, datetime objects, epoch, calendar, Python 3.14 new features
- ❌ SKIP: File I/O (Ch 22), OOP (Ch 24+), Advanced error handling (Ch 21 basics only), Future chapters

**Validation Checkpoints**:
- technical-reviewer MUST verify: AI CoLearning elements throughout, lesson closure pattern, Python 3.14 native approach, no SDD terminology
- Automated testing MUST verify: All code runs on Python 3.14+, no deprecated methods, type hints present
- Skills-proficiency-mapper MUST validate: A2-B1 progression smooth, cognitive load within limits, CEFR levels appropriate

**Success Metrics (from SC section)**:
- 85%+ capstone completion rate
- 80%+ demonstrate asking AI for concepts (not just code)
- 90%+ can explain WHEN to use methods (not just HOW)
- 100% compliance with AI CoLearning elements and lesson closure pattern

## Dependencies and Assumptions

**Dependencies**:
- **Chapter 14 (Data Types)**: Students know `int`, `float`, `str`, type hints basics
- **Chapter 16 (Strings)**: Students can work with string formatting, understand f-strings
- **Chapter 21 (Exception Handling)**: Students can use try/except for error handling
- **Python 3.14+**: All students must have Python 3.14 or later installed (new `strptime()` methods required)
- **Terminal with color support**: For observing calendar color highlighting feature (works in most modern terminals)

**Assumptions**:
- Students have Claude Code or Gemini CLI configured for AI-Native Learning exercises
- Students are comfortable asking AI questions and iterating based on responses
- Students can run Python code in terminal/IDE and observe output
- Students are intermediate learners (A2-B1 CEFR) who have completed Chapters 1-22
- No prior knowledge of advanced math concepts (calculus, complex numbers) required
- Basic understanding of timezones from daily life (EST, PST, UTC) but not technical details

**Non-Goals** (out of scope):
- Teaching advanced timezone libraries (pytz, dateutil) - use built-in `timezone` class only
- Comprehensive math theory (calculus, linear algebra) - focus on practical functions
- Database datetime storage - that's covered in later chapters (Part 12)
- Async datetime operations - that's Chapter 28 (Asyncio)
- Full-featured calendar applications - capstone is educational, not production-ready
