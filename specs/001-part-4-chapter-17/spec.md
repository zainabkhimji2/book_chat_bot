## Topic Summary

Chapter 17 teaches control flow and decision-making in Python—fundamental skills for writing programs that make decisions and repeat actions. Students learn to use conditional statements (`if/elif/else`, `match-case`) to direct program logic based on conditions, and loops (`for`, `while`) to automate repetition. This chapter builds on Chapters 13-16 (Python basics, data types, operators, strings) and prepares students for more complex programs in subsequent chapters.

The chapter emphasizes AI-Native Learning principles: students describe their intent using clear code structure and type hints, explore concepts through AI dialogue, validate their understanding through testing, and learn from errors by asking AI diagnostic questions. This intermediate-level chapter (A2-B1 proficiency) introduces 4-5 core concepts per lesson with progressive complexity, culminating in nested control structures that combine conditionals and loops.

**Key Pedagogical Approach**: Book teaches foundational syntax directly (Tier 1: if/elif/else, for/while basics), AI companion handles complex patterns (Tier 2: nested structures, match-case), and students practice describing intent for AI to execute. No capstone project—focus is on progressive concept mastery through targeted exercises.

   - Type hints and type checking (isinstance(), type())
   - Boolean values (True/False) as decision inputs

3. **Chapter 15: Operators, Keywords, and Variables**
   - **Comparison operators**: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= (CRITICAL for conditionals)
   - **Logical operators**: and, or, not (CRITICAL for complex conditions)
   - Variable scope and assignment

4. **Chapter 16: Strings and Type Casting**
   - String manipulation for user input
   - Type casting (int(), float(), str()) for validation

- Ask their AI companion to explain concepts and generate code
- Validate code output by testing with different inputs
