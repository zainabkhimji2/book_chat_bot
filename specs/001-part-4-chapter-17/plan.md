# Chapter 17: Control Flow and Loops — Detailed Lesson Plan

**Chapter Type**: Technical (Python code-focused)
**Part**: 4 - Python Fundamentals
**Complexity Tier**: Intermediate (A2-B1 CEFR Proficiency)
**Estimated Total Time**: 4-5 hours (60-75 minutes per lesson)
**Branch**: 001-part-4-chapter-17
**Date**: November 8, 2025

---

## Summary

Chapter 17 teaches decision-making and repetition in Python—core programming concepts that enable students to write programs that respond to conditions and automate repeated tasks. Students progress from simple conditionals (`if/else`) through pattern matching (`match-case`) and loop structures (`for`, `while`) to nested control flow combining both. The chapter builds sequentially on Chapters 13-16 (Python basics, data types, operators, strings) and emphasizes **AI-Native Learning**: students describe intent using clear code structure and type hints, explore patterns through dialogue with AI, validate logic through testing, and learn from errors by asking AI diagnostic questions.

**Key Pedagogical Approach**:
- **Tier 1 (Book Teaches)**: Foundational syntax and simple patterns (`if/else`, `for`, `while` basics)
- **Tier 2 (AI Companion)**: Complex patterns and conversions (`match-case`, nested structures, control flow optimization)
- **Student Role**: Describe intent clearly; validate and learn from AI-generated code

---

## Technical Context

**Language**: Python 3.14+
**No External Dependencies**: Uses only Python standard library
**Prerequisites**: Chapters 13-16 completed (Python basics, data types, operators, strings)
**Type Hints**: Mandatory on all function examples
**Code Testing**: All examples tested on Python 3.14.0
**AI Tools**: Claude Code, Gemini CLI (per learner preference)

---

## Constitution Alignment Check

**✓ Specification-First**: Spec document (spec.md) defines 5 lessons, learning objectives, code examples
**✓ Evals-First**: Chapter defines 13 success evals aligned to business goals (comprehension, skill acquisition, engagement, accessibility)
**✓ Graduated Teaching Pattern**: Lessons progress from Book Teaches (Tier 1) → AI Companion (Tier 2) across lessons
**✓ AI as Co-Reasoning Partner**: "Try With AI" sections integrate dialogue with AI for explanation, validation, and diagnostic learning
**✓ Validation-First Safety**: Every lesson includes Red Flags section and edge-case validation guidance
**✓ No Forward References**: All examples stay within Chapter 17 scope; no references to Chapters 30+ or advanced topics
**✓ Cognitive Load Management**: Each lesson respects A2 (max 7 concepts) and B1 (max 10 concepts) limits from CEFR research
**✓ Lesson Closure Pattern**: Every lesson ends with ONLY a "Try With AI" section (no separate "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next")

## Risks & Dependencies

### Technical Risks
- **Python 3.10+ Requirement**: Lesson 2 (match-case) requires Python 3.10+. Mitigation: Note in lesson with fallback to if/elif.
- **Type Hints Learning Curve**: Beginners may find type hints distracting. Mitigation: Explain they're optional during learning, mandatory in professional code.

### Pedagogical Risks
- **Nesting Complexity** (Lesson 5): Combining all concepts can overwhelm. Mitigation: Start with 2-level nesting; use visual examples (grids); mention functions as future simplification.
- **Infinite Loops**: Common student error. Mitigation: Red Flags section; AI troubleshooting prompt ready; clear examples of proper termination.

### Dependencies
- **Chapter 13-16**: Must be completed before Chapter 17
  - Ch 13: Variables and assignment
  - Ch 14: Boolean type and type hints
  - Ch 15: Comparison and logical operators (CRITICAL)
  - Ch 16: String type and input() function
- **AI Tool Access**: Students need Claude Code or Gemini CLI (available from Parts 1-3)
- **Python 3.14+**: All code examples require Python 3.14; assume `uv` is installed

### Dependency Validation
- [ ] Chapter 13 status: ✅ Implemented
- [ ] Chapter 14 status: ✅ Implemented & Validated
- [ ] Chapter 15 status: 📋 Planned (verify before linking)
- [ ] Chapter 16 status: 📋 Planned (verify before linking)

**Note**: Chapters 15-16 listed as "Planned" in chapter-index.md, but Chapter 17 spec assumes they're complete. **Action**: Verify status before lesson-writer starts; add quick review sections if needed.
