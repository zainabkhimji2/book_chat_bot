# Tasks: Chapter 17 - Control Flow and Loops

**Feature Branch**: `001-part-4-chapter-17`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-part-4-chapter-17/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), spec.md (✓)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by lesson (treating each lesson as a "user story") to enable independent implementation and validation of each lesson.

**Tests**: No automated tests required for book content. Validation is manual (technical review, readability checks, code example testing).

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Lesson] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Lesson]**: Which lesson this task belongs to (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

- [X] T004 [P] Set up Python 3.14 testing environment for code examples

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core resources and shared content that ALL lessons depend on

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No lesson writing can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T005 Document "Try With AI" format standard: 4 prompts per lesson (Recall → Understand → Apply → Analyze/Evaluate/Synthesize)
- [X] T006 Document CoLearning elements format: 💬 AI Colearning Prompt, 🎓 Instructor Commentary, 🚀 CoLearning Challenge, ✨ Teaching Tip
- [X] T007 Document lesson closure requirement: ONLY "Try With AI" section (no "Key Takeaways", "Summary", or "What's Next")
- [X] T008 Document Graduated Teaching Pattern labels: Tier 1 (Book Teaches), Tier 2 (AI Companion)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all lesson writing
- **Lessons (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - Lessons can proceed sequentially (L1 → L2 → L3 → L4 → L5) in priority order
  - OR Lessons 2-5 can start in parallel once Lesson 1 is complete (if multiple writers available)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all 5 lessons being complete

### Lesson Dependencies

- **Lesson 1 (L1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other lessons
- **Lesson 2 (L2)**: Should reference Lesson 1 concepts (if/elif/else for comparison) - Can start after L1 complete
- **Lesson 3 (L3)**: Independent of L2 - Can start after Foundational (Phase 2)
- **Lesson 4 (L4)**: Depends on Lesson 3 (basic for/while loops) - Can start after L3 complete
- **Lesson 5 (L5)**: Integrates ALL Lessons 1-4 - MUST wait for L1-4 complete

### Within Each Lesson

- YAML frontmatter before content
- Main content sections before AI Companion sections
- Red Flags after all code examples
- "Try With AI" section LAST (lesson closure)
- Code testing before lesson validation

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Lessons 2 and 3 can be written in parallel (after L1 complete, before L5 starts)
- All Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 8)

---

## Parallel Example: Lessons 2 and 3

```bash
# After Lesson 1 is complete, launch Lessons 2 and 3 together:
Task: "Write Lesson 2 (match-case) in 02-pattern-matching-with-match-case.md"
Task: "Write Lesson 3 (loops) in 03-repetition-with-loops.md"

# These are independent and can be written by different authors simultaneously
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Lesson 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all lessons)
3. Complete Phase 3: Lesson 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test Lesson 1 independently with technical-reviewer
5. Get human approval before proceeding

### Sequential Delivery (Recommended for Solo Author)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Write Lesson 1 → Test independently → Approve
3. Write Lesson 2 → Test independently → Approve
4. Write Lesson 3 → Test independently → Approve
5. Write Lesson 4 → Test independently → Approve
6. Write Lesson 5 → Test independently → Approve
7. Complete Polish phase → Chapter ready for publication

### Parallel Team Strategy (If Multiple Authors Available)

With multiple writers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Author A: Lesson 1
3. Once Lesson 1 approved:
   - Author A: Lesson 4 (depends on L3)
   - Author B: Lesson 2 (can start in parallel)
   - Author C: Lesson 3 (can start in parallel)
4. Once Lessons 1-4 approved:
   - Lead Author: Lesson 5 (integrates all concepts)
5. Team completes Polish together

---

## Policy Notes

**Lesson Closure Requirement**: Within Chapter 17, each lesson MUST end with a single final section titled "Try With AI" containing 4 prompts following Bloom's taxonomy progression (Recall → Understand → Apply → Analyze/Evaluate/Synthesize). No "Key Takeaways", "Summary", or "What's Next" sections are permitted.

**AI Tool Usage**: Before Part 5 (where Claude Code and Gemini CLI are taught), use ChatGPT web in "Try With AI" sections. After tool onboarding (Parts 1-3), instruct learners to use their preferred AI companion tool (e.g., Gemini CLI, Claude CLI), optionally providing both CLI and web variants.

**Type Hints**: All code examples MUST include type hints on variables and function parameters. This is non-negotiable per constitution (modern Python standards).

**Python Version**: All code examples MUST run on Python 3.14+. Lesson 2 requires Python 3.10+ for match-case (note this prominently).

**No Forward References**: Do NOT reference Chapters 30+ (Specification-Driven Development) or Part 5 concepts. Use AI-Native Learning terminology (describe intent, explore with AI, validate together) instead of formal SDD terminology (write spec, generate from spec).

---

## Total Task Count

- **Setup**: 4 tasks
- **Foundational**: 5 tasks
- **Lesson 1**: 15 tasks
- **Lesson 2**: 15 tasks
- **Lesson 3**: 15 tasks
- **Lesson 4**: 15 tasks
- **Lesson 5**: 16 tasks
- **Polish**: 13 tasks

**TOTAL**: 98 tasks

### Tasks by Lesson

- Lesson 1 (L1): 15 tasks
- Lesson 2 (L2): 15 tasks
- Lesson 3 (L3): 15 tasks
- Lesson 4 (L4): 15 tasks
- Lesson 5 (L5): 16 tasks

### Parallel Opportunities Identified

- 11 tasks marked [P] (can run in parallel within phases)
- Lessons 2 and 3 can be written in parallel (after L1 complete)

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product**: Lesson 1 only (15 implementation tasks + 4 setup + 5 foundational = 24 tasks)

This delivers foundational conditional logic (if/elif/else) and validates the teaching approach before committing to full chapter implementation.
