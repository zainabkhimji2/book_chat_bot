# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 7 Bash Essentials Redesign

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Spec is pedagogical (educational content), focused on learning outcomes and student experience. No technical implementation details leaked into requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All requirements are clear. Success criteria use measurable outcomes (e.g., "Students can conduct 5+ conversations", "80% complete orchestration challenge", "Grade 7-8 reading level"). Five open questions identified but are enhancement considerations, not blocking clarifications.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**:
- 5 user stories prioritized (P1: Navigation and Safety, P2: Configuration and Comprehension, P3: Orchestration)
- Each story is independently testable
- Success criteria align with user stories (navigation conversations, safety pattern application, command comprehension, orchestration)
- Pedagogical focus maintained throughout

## Validation Results

### Passing Criteria ✅

1. **Content Quality**: All sections completed, no implementation leakage
2. **Testability**: Each user story has concrete acceptance scenarios
3. **Measurability**: Success criteria include specific metrics (conversation count, completion rates, reading level)
4. **Clarity**: No ambiguous requirements requiring clarification
5. **Scope**: Clear boundaries (in scope vs. out of scope)
6. **Dependencies**: Prerequisites and dependent chapters identified
7. **Risks**: 5 major risks identified with mitigation strategies

### Open Questions (Non-Blocking)

The specification includes 5 open questions:

1. **Include "Bash for AI Agents" section?** (Enhancement consideration)
   - **Recommendation**: Yes, but brief (1-2 paragraphs in introduction) to help students understand AI's perspective
   - **Rationale**: Builds mental model of AI collaboration without adding cognitive load

2. **Demonstrate multiple AI tools side-by-side?** (Presentation choice)
   - **Recommendation**: Show one tool per example, note variations in callouts
   - **Rationale**: Prevents cognitive overload; students can try different tools in exercises

3. **Include troubleshooting appendix?** (Reference material)
   - **Recommendation**: Yes, end-of-chapter quick reference
   - **Rationale**: Useful for students encountering errors; doesn't interrupt lesson flow

4. **Show dangerous bash patterns with explanations?** (Safety education)
   - **Recommendation**: Yes, in safety lesson with "Never Do This" examples
   - **Rationale**: Reinforces safety-first mindset; students recognize red flags

5. **Git bash integration vs. keeping git for Chapter 8?** (Scope boundary)
   - **Recommendation**: Use `git status` naturally in navigation examples, full git in Chapter 8
   - **Rationale**: Students already know git basics from Part 1; showing status doesn't spoil Chapter 8 content

**Decision**: All open questions answered above. Recommendations do not block planning phase.

## Pedagogical Alignment

- [x] **Graduated Complexity**: Tier 1 (beginner) appropriate for Part 2
- [x] **Cognitive Load**: Max 5 concepts per lesson enforced
- [x] **AI-Native Pattern**: Natural language → AI execution → Student observation
- [x] **Safety-First**: 5-step pattern emphasized before destructive operations
- [x] **Real Behavior**: Requirements specify authentic AI dialogue including errors
- [x] **Validation Skills**: Supervision and verification taught alongside execution

**Notes**: Spec adheres to Constitution v3.0.0 graduated teaching principles. Explicitly follows Tier 1 (book teaches foundational), Tier 2 (AI handles complex syntax), Tier 3 (AI orchestrates multi-step workflows).

## Ready for Next Phase

**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED** - Ready for `/sp.plan`

**Rationale**:
- All mandatory sections complete and high-quality
- Success criteria measurable and aligned with learning outcomes
- User stories prioritized and independently testable
- Risks identified with concrete mitigation strategies
- Open questions answered with recommendations
- No blocking issues or critical gaps

**Next Steps**:
1. User reviews and approves specification
2. Proceed to `/sp.plan` to generate lesson-by-lesson breakdown
3. After plan approval, use `/sp.tasks` to create implementation task checklist
