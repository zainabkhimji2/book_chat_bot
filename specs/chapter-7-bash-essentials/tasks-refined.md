---

## Implementation Strategy

**Week 1**: Setup (Phase 1) + Foundation Lessons 1-2 (Phase 2)
**Week 2**: Command Comprehension Lesson 3 (Phase 3) + Start File Ops/Config (Phase 4)
**Week 3**: Complete File Ops/Config Lessons 4-5 (Phase 4) + Start Orchestration (Phase 5)
**Week 4**: Complete Orchestration Lessons 6-8 (Phase 5) + Integration (Phase 6)
**Week 5**: Final polish, README rewrite, Docusaurus validation, publication

**Suggested MVP Scope** (if time-constrained):
- **MVP = Lessons 1-5 only** (Navigation, Safety, Comprehension, File Ops, Config)
- Defer Lessons 6-8 (Orchestration) to Phase 2 release
- Rationale: First 5 lessons cover P1 and P2 user stories. Orchestration (P3) is advanced and can follow.
