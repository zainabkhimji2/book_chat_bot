# AI Native Software Development: Colearning Agentic AI with Python and TypeScript – The AI & Spec Driven Way — Project Constitution

**Version:** 3.1.3 | **Ratified:** 2025-10-31 | **Last Amended:** 2025-01-11

---

## 📌 How to Read This Constitution

This constitution describes both:

1. **Current Reality** — What exists today (infrastructure, implemented content, operational capabilities)
2. **Future State** — What we're building toward (aspirational architecture, planned expansions)

**Why This Matters**: Clear separation prevents confusion. When you read "55 chapters across 13 parts", that's the Future State vision. When you need to know what's actually implemented, refer to `specs/book/chapter-index.md` which tracks actual chapter status.

**Navigation**:

- Sections marked **🔵 Future State** describe aspirational goals (use this for long-term planning)
- Sections without markers describe principles that apply to both current and future work
- **For current implementation status**: See `specs/book/chapter-index.md` (chapter counts, completion status)
- **For file structure examples**: See actual content in `book-source/docs/` directory

---

## I. Project Vision & Philosophy

### Vision

"AI Native Software Development: Colearning Agentic AI with Python and TypeScript – The AI & Spec Driven Way" is a technical book teaching AI-native software development methodology where specification-writing is the primary skill and AI agents handle implementation.

**🔵 Future State Target**: 56 chapters across 13 parts
**Current Implementation**: See `specs/book/chapter-index.md` for actual chapter counts and status

This book demonstrates how to build production-ready AI systems by:

1. **Thinking in Specifications** — Decomposing problems into clear, testable requirements
2. **Collaborating with AI** — Using Claude Code, Gemini CLI as co-learning partners
3. **Validating Outputs** — Testing and verifying AI-generated code systematically
4. **Deploying at Scale** — Production deployment with Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud-native patterns

**The Paradigm Shift**: In AI-native development, your ability to articulate intent clearly (specification) is MORE valuable than your ability to type syntax manually. The developer's role transforms from "code writer" to "specification designer and output validator." collaboratively with your AI Agents.

### The Fundamental Skill Shift: "Specs Are the New Syntax"

In traditional programming, the primary skill was **mastering syntax**—memorizing language constructs and typing implementations manually. In AI-native development, the primary skill is **mastering specifications**—articulating intent so clearly that AI agents execute flawlessly.

**"Specs are the new syntax."** Just as developers once studied language reference manuals to write code, AI-native developers study specification patterns to direct intelligent agents.

**What Changed:**
- **Old paradigm:** Your value = how fast you type correct syntax
- **New paradigm:** Your value = how clearly you articulate requirements
- **Bottom line:** Specification quality determines output quality

This isn't just a productivity hack—it's a fundamental transformation of what "programming" means in the agentic era. You're not learning to write code faster; you're learning to think in specifications that AI can execute.

### From User Interface to User Intent

The agentic AI era fundamentally transforms human-computer interaction:

**Traditional Software (Interface-Driven):**
- Users navigate through menus, forms, and workflows
- Every action requires explicit commands
- Software waits for user input to proceed

**Agentic AI (Intent-Driven):**
- Users state high-level goals in natural language
- AI agents plan and execute multi-step workflows autonomously
- Systems proactively anticipate and act

This shift from "how to do" (interfaces) to "what to achieve" (intent) is the foundation of specification-first development. In this new paradigm, your ability to articulate intent clearly (specification) becomes more valuable than your ability to navigate interfaces or type syntax manually.

### AI Agent Capabilities: The Five Powers

Modern AI agents possess comprehensive capabilities that enable them to operate as true partners in development:

1. **👁️ See** - Visual understanding (images, screenshots, diagrams, UI layouts)
2. **👂 Hear** - Audio processing (voice commands, sound analysis, transcription)
3. **🧠 Reason** - Complex decision-making, multi-step problem-solving, and strategic planning
4. **⚡ Act** - Execute tasks, use tools, orchestrate workflows, and make changes
5. **💾 Remember** - Maintain context across sessions, learn from interactions, and build knowledge

These five powers enable agents to move beyond text generation into true collaboration. This book teaches you to leverage all five powers in specification design, validation workflows, and production systems. Understanding these capabilities helps you write better specifications—you can ask your AI agent to "look at this diagram and explain the architecture" or "listen to this voice recording and transcribe it" because you know what's possible.

**From Large Language Models to Large Action Models**

The agentic AI era represents a fundamental evolution in how we interact with AI systems. What started with ChatGPT as the world's first widely accessible linguistic interface—one with no language barrier, where human-computer interaction happens through conversation, not clicks—has now evolved into something more powerful: autonomous agents that don't just respond, but act.

As Sandeep Alur (CTO, Microsoft Innovation Hub) explained at TechSparks2025:
> "We're moving from large language models to large action models where AI doesn't just respond, it acts, orchestrates, and remembers."

This shift from **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to **Large Action Models (LAMs)** marks the transition from passive AI (waiting for prompts) to agentic AI (proactively executing workflows):

- **LLMs (respond):** ChatGPT answers "What is Docker?" with an explanation
- **LAMs (act):** AI agent hears "Deploy my app" and orchestrates: build → test → containerize → deploy → verify

**This Book's Focus:** We teach LAMs-style development where AI agents autonomously execute multi-step workflows from specifications, not just generate text responses. You learn to write specifications that LAMs can act upon—transforming intent ("I need authentication") into working systems (generated code, tests, deployment configs) through AI orchestration.

The agentic experience redefines how we work and build, where AI no longer waits for detailed instructions but learns to trigger coordinated actions on its own. This is the paradigm shift from user interface (clicking buttons) to user intent (stating goals)—and it's already here.

### Book Progression

This book progresses from AI-native mindset (Parts 1-3) through bilingual full-stack development (Python reasoning + TypeScript interaction) to production deployment with containers, orchestration, databases, and stateful agent systems (Parts 10-13).

### The Nine Pillars of AI-Native Development

This book is built on nine foundational pillars that define modern AI-native software development:

1. **🤖 AI CLI & Coding Agents** — Claude Code, Gemini CLI as primary development interfaces (Principle 11, Part 2)

2. **📝 Markdown as Lingua Franca** — Natural language specifications become executable (Part 3)

3. **🔌 Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — Universal standard for AI agent tool integration (Part 7)

4. **💻 AI-First IDEs** — Zed, Cursor, and development environments built for AI collaboration (Principle 11)

5. **🐧 Cross-Platform Development** — Linux/WSL/Mac unified development environment (Parts 4, 8)

6. **✅ Evaluation Drive, Eval Analysis and Test-Driven Development** — For quality confidence at scale (Principle 4)

7. **📋 Specification-Driven Development** — SpecKit Plus structured methodology (Principle 2, Part 5)

8. **🧩 Composable Domain Skills** — Reusable pedagogical and technical components (Section II.B)

9. **☁️ Universal Cloud-Native Deployment** — Docker, Kubernetes, Dapr standardized infrastructure (Principle 17, Parts 10-13)

These pillars work together to create a complete AI-native development environment that is **learnable, teachable, and professionally relevant**.

### Core Philosophy

1. **Progressive AI Integration Spectrum**
   AI adoption follows a natural progression: Assisted (helper accelerating manual work) → Driven (co-creator generating from specifications) → Native (core product capability). This book teaches Driven practices (spec → generate → validate) and Native architectures (agents as first-class citizens), while acknowledging Assisted techniques remain useful in early learning. (See detailed framework in "AI Development Spectrum" section below.)

2. **AI as Co-Learning Partner (Bidirectional Learning)**
   **"Co-learning between human and machine"** is the heart of AI-native development. AI agents are collaborative partners in THINKING and LEARNING—this is bidirectional co-learning where both parties become smarter through collaboration:

   **Human teaches AI:**
   - Domain context and business requirements
   - Project-specific constraints and priorities
   - Quality standards and acceptance criteria
   - Feedback on generated outputs

   **AI teaches Human:**
   - Best practices and proven patterns
   - Language features and modern syntax
   - Architecture options and tradeoffs
   - Security considerations and pitfalls

   **Together, they co-create specifications:** Human articulates intent and requirements, AI suggests structure and refinements, human evaluates and guides, AI learns preferences and adapts. This iterative specification co-creation is the heart of AI-native development. Neither is subordinate; both become smarter through collaboration.

3. **Specification-First Development ("Specs Are the New Syntax")**
   After understanding the AI partnership spectrum, **specification-writing becomes THE primary skill**. In the old paradigm, you learned programming syntax; in the new paradigm, you learn specification syntax. Clear specifications → AI generates implementation → Human validates against evals. The developer's job is strategic thinking and verification, not manual typing. In AI-native workflows, specification quality directly determines output quality.
   
   **Specs are the new syntax.** Master this, and you master AI-native development.

4. **Evals-First Development (Professional AI-Native Pattern)**
   Define success criteria and evaluation methods BEFORE writing specifications or code. Professional AI development follows: **Evals → Spec → Implement → Validate**. This is the inverse of traditional TDD (test-after). In AI-native workflows, you define "what good looks like" first (evals/benchmarks), then write specs to achieve it, then generate implementation, then validate against evals. Companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind use this pattern for all AI system development.

   **Critical**: Evals must connect to **business goals**, not arbitrary technical metrics. Evals vary by context:

   - **Book chapter evals**: Reader comprehension (can student explain concept?), skill acquisition (can student apply technique?), engagement (did student complete chapter?), accessibility (reading level appropriate?)
   - **Code/feature evals**: Functional correctness (does it solve the user problem?), performance (meets user expectations?), reliability (error rate acceptable?), maintainability (can team modify it?)
   - **AI product evals**: User success rate (% completing task), accuracy on real use cases (not synthetic benchmarks), safety/alignment (harmful output rate), user satisfaction (NPS, retention)

   **Relationship to User Stories**: User stories describe **WHAT** users want to do (intent). Evals define **HOW to measure** if that intent was achieved (objective success criteria). User stories are qualitative narratives; evals are quantitative measurements. Example: User story "I want to learn SDD" → Evals: "75%+ write valid spec (quiz), 80%+ identify vague requirements (test), Grade 7 reading level (automated check)."

   Teach collaborators to capture evals in specs: "What business outcome must this achieve? How will we measure success? What failure modes matter most to users?"

5. **Validation-First Safety**
   Never trust, always verify. All AI-generated code must be read, understood, tested, and validated against evals before use. Validation skills are as important as specification skills. Professional developers validate everything: syntax, types, security, functionality, spec alignment, and eval passage.

6. **Bilingual Full-Stack Development**
   Professional AI-native developers are fluent in both Python (reasoning/backend) and TypeScript (interaction/frontend). Modern AI systems require both: Python for agents and data processing, TypeScript for user interfaces and real-time interaction. Both languages receive equal emphasis.

7. **Learning by Building**
   Every concept is practiced through building real, deployable systems—not toy examples. Projects progress from evals → specification → implementation → validation → deployment, demonstrating the complete AI-native development lifecycle.

8. **Progressive Complexity**
   Beginners start with simple specifications and AI-assisted implementation (Parts 1-3). Professionals handle complex architectures, multi-agent systems, and production deployment (Parts 10-13). The methodology scales with the developer—the principles remain constant while the complexity increases.

9. **Transparency & Methodology**
   We don't just teach WHAT to build—we teach HOW we think, plan, specify, validate, and iterate. The book models the AI-native methodology it teaches. Every chapter shows evals first, then specifications, AI prompts, generated outputs, and validation steps.

### AI Development Spectrum (Assisted → Driven → Native)

To ground our methodology, we explicitly distinguish three approaches to using AI in software work. These represent a progression of integration and responsibility, not mutually exclusive categories.

**Visual Model:**
```
AI ASSISTED          AI DRIVEN                AI NATIVE
───────────          ─────────                ─────────
Helper               Co-Creator               Core System
↓                    ↓                        ↓
Autocomplete         Spec → Implement         Agent Runtime
Refactoring          Generate scaffolds       Natural language UI
Test stubs           Validate outputs         Autonomous reasoning

PRODUCTIVITY         METHODOLOGY              PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE
10-30% faster        10x faster               AI is the product
```

#### AI Assisted Development

- **Role of AI:** Productivity helper for individual developers (completion, suggestions, refactoring, documentation, test stubs)
- **Role of Human:** Full control of design and architecture; AI accelerates typing and routine tasks
- **Typical Outputs:** Faster code, fewer typos, small-scale automation
- **Example:** Using an assistant to speed up building a traditional FastAPI service or Next.js app

#### AI‑Driven Development (AIDD)

- **Role of AI:** Co‑creator generating significant portions of implementation from clear specifications
- **Role of Human:** Director/architect/validator—writes specs, reviews AI output, drives iteration and quality
- **Typical Outputs:** End‑to‑end scaffolds, APIs with tests, UI components, refactors guided by acceptance criteria
- **Example:** Provide a REST API specification; AI generates FastAPI routes, models, validation, tests, and docs

#### AI‑Native Software Development

- **Role of AI:** Core runtime capability; the application itself depends on intelligent agents/models
- **Role of Human:** System designer of agentic behaviors, context, prompts/tools, data, and deployment
- **Typical Outputs:** Agents with reasoning and tool use, natural language interfaces, adaptive systems
- **Example:** A support agent that reasons over context, coordinates tools/agents, and autonomously resolves tickets

#### Why This Book Emphasizes Driven and Native

**This Book's Scope:**
- ✅ AI-Assisted techniques (covered implicitly throughout)
- ⭐ AI-Driven workflow (primary focus: spec → generate → validate)
- ⭐ AI-Native architecture (Parts 6-13: building agent systems)

**Career Relevance:**
- **Assisted skills** = table stakes (everyone has these by 2026)
- **Driven methodology** = professional differentiator (what this book teaches)
- **Native architecture** = high-value specialization (advanced content)

We teach AI‑Driven practices (spec → generate → validate) as the default workflow for building software quickly and reliably, and AI‑Native architectures where intelligent agents are first‑class, using OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP, and TypeScript frontends. Assisted techniques remain useful and are taught early, but the professional bar is the ability to design specifications and agent systems.

### Target Audience

**Primary: Aspiring Developers**

- No prior programming experience required
- Strong emphasis on clear thinking and problem decomposition
- Comfortable learning through AI collaboration
- Goal: Build and deploy real applications quickly using AI-native workflows

**Secondary: Professional Developers**

- Have traditional programming background
- Want to leverage AI for 10x productivity
- Need to understand specification-driven development
- Goal: Transform existing skills for AI-augmented work

**Tertiary: Technical Founders and Entrepreneurs**

- Need to build MVPs and validate ideas rapidly
- Limited time for deep syntax learning
- Strong product sense but limited coding background
- Goal: Ship AI-native products to market without hiring large engineering teams

### Your Role: From Consumer to Creator

As Einstein said, **"There comes a time we need to stop reading the books of others. And write our own."** This book teaches you to:

- **Stop consuming** others' code and start **generating** your own systems
- **Stop following** tutorials and start **creating** original solutions
- **Stop learning** syntax and start **designing** specifications

AI-native development isn't about reading more documentation—it's about **writing your own specifications** that become working software. You're not training to be a better code typist; you're training to be a **system architect and specification designer**.

**Your book** is the software you build. **Your syntax** is the specifications you write. **Your authorship** is the problems you solve with AI as your co-author.

### Why AI Makes Developers MORE Valuable

**The Paradox:** As AI tools become more powerful at generating code, skilled developers become MORE valuable, not less.

**The Constraint Shift:**
- **Old bottleneck:** How fast can developers type code?
- **New bottleneck:** How quickly can developers design great systems and make strategic decisions?

The latter requires human expertise, judgment, creativity, and domain understanding—skills that AI enhances rather than replaces.

**Market Reality:**
- AI increases developer productivity 10x
- This EXPANDS the market for software (more projects become economically viable)
- Companies that couldn't afford custom software now can
- Individuals can create tools for personal use
- Demand for software is INCREASING, not decreasing

**Value Shift:**
- **Low-value work** (mechanical typing, syntax debugging) → Automated by AI
- **High-value work** (system design, tradeoff decisions, quality assurance) → Amplified by AI collaboration
- Developers focus on what humans do best: strategic thinking and creative problem-solving

**Career Security:** The developers at risk are those who only know syntax without understanding systems, architecture, or specifications. The developers thriving are those who master specification design, system architecture, and AI orchestration—exactly what this book teaches.

**Bottom Line:** AI doesn't replace developers; it automates the boring parts and amplifies the valuable parts. This book teaches you the high-value skills that remain uniquely human.

### Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy (file management, terminal basics)
- Curiosity about AI and willingness to experiment
- Logical thinking and problem-solving mindset
- **NOT required**: Programming experience, CS degree, syntax knowledge

**The Core Insight**: In the AI-native era, learning to think clearly and communicate intent precisely is more important than memorizing syntax.

### Why This Is the Best Time to Learn Software Development

**The Accessibility Revolution:**

Barriers that kept people out of programming for 50 years are dissolving:

**Before AI agents, becoming a developer required:**
- ❌ **Memorizing syntax** — Hundreds of commands, keywords, patterns for each language
- ❌ **Debugging cryptic errors** — Hours deciphering compiler messages and stack traces
- ❌ **Configuring environments** — Complex toolchain setup that differed per project
- ❌ **Understanding low-level details** — Memory management, pointer arithmetic, registers
- ❌ **Reading thousands of pages** — Language documentation, API references, style guides

**With AI agents, you focus on:**
- ✅ **Understanding problems** — What needs to be built and why
- ✅ **Designing solutions** — Architecture, tradeoffs, and strategic decisions
- ✅ **Writing specifications** — Clear articulation of requirements and constraints
- ✅ **Validating outputs** — Testing, security scanning, and quality assurance
- ✅ **Building systems** — Integration, deployment, and real-world operation

**The mechanical parts are automated. The creative parts are amplified.**

**The Catch:**

Traditional CS education emphasizes **exactly the skills AI automates best**:
- Algorithm memorization → AI generates optimal algorithms on demand
- Syntax fluency → AI writes perfect syntax in any language
- Low-level implementation → AI handles boilerplate and repetitive code
- Manual debugging → AI identifies and fixes issues faster

If you're learning to code the way universities taught in 2020, you're preparing for a job that's already obsolete. **That's not an insult to traditional education—it's recognition that the world changed faster than curricula could adapt.**

**The good news**: You can learn the RIGHT skills (specification design, system architecture, AI orchestration) faster than ever before, because AI accelerates the learning process itself.

**The New Skills That Matter:**

This book teaches what AI CAN'T automate:
- **Understanding what to build** (problem analysis and requirements gathering)
- **Designing architectures that scale** (system thinking and tradeoff evaluation)
- **Making tradeoff decisions** (judgment, priorities, and business alignment)
- **Ensuring quality and security** (validation, testing, and safety verification)
- **Coordinating across systems** (orchestration and integration)

**The Bottom Line:**

This is the best time to enter software development—not despite AI, but **because of it**. AI has lowered the barrier to entry while raising the ceiling of what's possible. You can build production systems in weeks that would have taken teams months. The one-person unicorn (solo developer building impactful software) is no longer science fiction—it's the reality of the agentic era.

## II. Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### Principle 1: AI-First Teaching Philosophy

Every concept, example, and exercise MUST demonstrate AI-assisted development as the primary workflow, not an afterthought.

**Why This Matters:** In 2025 and beyond, professional developers collaborate WITH AI, not despite it. Teaching programming without AI collaboration is teaching an outdated workflow. Students must develop AI partnership skills from day one to be professionally relevant.

**What This Means:**

- AI tools introduced early (Part 2) and used throughout every chapter
- Every code example shows: specification → AI prompt → generated code → validation
- Students learn to write effective specifications and prompts as core skills
- AI positioned as co-learning partner, not autocomplete tool
- Traditional "manual coding first, AI later" approach explicitly rejected as outdated

---

### Principle 2: Spec-Kit Plus Methodology as THE Foundation

Specification-Driven Development (SDD) using Spec-Kit Plus is THE core methodology taught throughout the book, not a supplementary topic.

**Why This Matters:** In AI-native development, specifications ARE the source code. Clear specs → working software (via AI generation). Poor specs → broken software. SDD is scalable, AI-friendly, and enables professional team collaboration. This is the foundational skill that enables everything else.

**What This Means:**

- Part 5 dedicated entirely to Spec-Driven Development methodology
- ALL projects use Spec-Kit Plus structure: spec.md → plan.md → tasks.md → implementation
- Students practice writing specifications WITH AI assistance (iterative refinement)
- Constitution, ADR, PHR concepts explained and practiced as real development artifacts
- Every code example includes the specification that produced it
- Specification quality is a primary success metric (not just "does code run?")

**Application:**

- Part 5 chapters teach SDD formally
- ALL subsequent parts apply SDD to every project
- Refer to `specs/book/chapter-index.md` for specific chapter assignments and current status

### The 10x to 99x Multiplier: How Mindset Determines Productivity

The productivity gains from AI-native development scale with your mindset transformation:

**10x Productivity: AI-Driven Mindset**
- You write specifications, AI generates implementation
- Clear thinking → Clear specs → Working code
- Base efficiency: 5x (70h traditional → 15h spec-driven)
- With iteration benefits: **10x realistic multiplier**

**99x Productivity: AI-Native Mindset** 
- You orchestrate AI agents as system designer
- Think in problem domains, not code syntax
- Platform-level patterns, not individual features
- Multi-agent collaboration at scale

**The Progression:**

| Level | Mindset | How You Work | Multiplier |
|-------|---------|--------------|------------|
| **Assisted** | AI is autocomplete | Write code, AI suggests | 2-3x |
| **Driven** | AI generates from specs | Write specs, AI implements | 5-10x ✅ |
| **Native** | AI orchestrates systems | Design problems, AI solves | 50-99x ✅ |

**Why the Range?**

The difference between 10x and 99x isn't just tools—it's **transformation**:

1. **Specification Quality** (10x → 30x)
   - Beginner specs: Vague requirements → AI generates, but requires heavy rework
   - Expert specs: Crystal-clear intent → AI generates production-ready code
   - **Multiplier boost: 3x**

2. **Orchestration Scale** (30x → 60x)
   - Solo work: One human + one AI agent
   - Platform work: One human orchestrating multiple specialized AI agents
   - **Multiplier boost: 2x**

3. **Reusable Patterns** (60x → 99x)
   - First project: Learning spec-first methodology
   - Tenth project: Refined specification library + organizational AI context
   - **Multiplier boost: 1.65x** (compound learning)

**Mathematical Validation:**

**Traditional Development (Simple Feature):**
- Write code manually: 40 hours
- Write documentation: 10 hours
- Write tests: 15 hours
- Organize and refactor: 5 hours
- **Total:** 70 hours

**Spec-Driven Development (Same Feature):**
- Write specification: 10 hours (human strategic work—high value)
- AI generates code, docs, tests: 1 hour (automated)
- Human review and validation: 4 hours
- **Total:** 15 hours

**Base Multiplier:** 70 ÷ 15 ≈ **5x** ✅

**Real-World Validation (Enterprise System, 2-year project):**

**Traditional Development:**
- Team of 3 developers: 3 × 40h/week × 100 weeks = 12,000 hours
- Requirements changes, bug fixes, documentation drift
- Coordination overhead, context switching
- **Total:** ~5,000 productive hours (after accounting for overhead)

**AI-Native Development (Same System):**
- 1 orchestrator: Specification design (50h) + iteration/refinement (30h) + validation (20h)
- AI agents: Implementation, testing, documentation (parallel execution, human supervision)
- Zero coordination overhead (single orchestrator)
- Zero documentation drift (regenerated from specs)
- **Total:** ~100 orchestration hours

**Multiplier: 5,000 ÷ 100 = 50x** (approaching 99x) ✅

**The Key Insight:**

You don't **get** 99x—you **grow into** 99x through mindset transformation:
- **Parts 1-3:** Learn tools (2-3x, AI-Assisted)
- **Parts 4-5:** Master specs (5-10x, AI-Driven) ← Most readers plateau here
- **Parts 6+:** Think like architect (50-99x, AI-Native) ← The transformation

**This book teaches all three levels.** Your multiplier depends on how deeply you embrace the paradigm shift from "coder" to "specification designer" to "system orchestrator."

**Real-World Impact:**
- Time to market: 70% reduction ✅
- Development speed: 5-10x increase ✅
- Consistency: 100% (no manual synchronization errors) ✅
- Maintenance cost: 90% reduction (change spec, regenerate everything) ✅

**The Bottom Line:**
- **10x is achievable** by anyone who learns specification-first development
- **99x is achievable** by those who fully transform to AI-native thinking
- The journey from 10x → 99x is **learning to think in specifications, not syntax**

### Principle 3: Modern Python Standards (3.13+)

All Python code MUST use Python 3.13+ features with mandatory type hints throughout.

**Why This Matters:** Type hints are now standard in professional Python development. Teaching without them creates technical debt and bad habits. Modern syntax (match/case, structural patterns) improves readability. Students must learn current best practices, not legacy patterns. Type hints also improve AI code generation quality.

**What This Means:**

- Python 3.13+ syntax required; no legacy patterns or compatibility code
- Type hints mandatory for all function signatures (zero exceptions)
- Modern syntax features demonstrated and explained (walrus operator, structural pattern matching, etc.)
- No pre-3.10 type hint styles (e.g., `Optional` from typing module - use `str | None`)
- All code validated for type safety (mypy --strict or pyright)

---

### Principle 4: Test-First Mindset

Testing concepts MUST be integrated early and practiced throughout, not relegated to a single late chapter.

**Why This Matters:** Professional code is tested code. Introducing testing late makes it seem optional. Early integration normalizes testing as part of development. AI tools excel at generating tests from specifications—this is a perfect AI-native workflow (spec → AI generates code + tests → human validates).

**What This Means:**

- Unit testing introduced early in Part 4 (Python fundamentals)
- Every significant code example includes corresponding tests
- Test-writing shown as AI-assisted workflow: "Generate tests for this specification"
- TDD workflow demonstrated: write test → see it fail → generate implementation → see it pass
- Coverage expectations enforced: critical functions 100%, overall >80%
- Validation includes running tests, not just visual inspection

---

### Principle 5: Progressive Complexity with Clear Scaffolding

Content difficulty MUST increase gradually with no sudden jumps. Earlier parts have heavy support; later parts assume increasing independence.

**Why This Matters:** Beginners need scaffolding. Jumping complexity levels loses readers. Clear prerequisite chains allow modular learning and reference. Progressive complexity reduces frustration and increases completion rates. BUT: advanced readers need professional-level content, not oversimplified examples.

**What This Means:**

- **Graduated Scaffolding** (not one-size-fits-all):
  - Parts 1-3: Maximum scaffolding (complete beginners, 2 options max, simple specs)
  - Parts 4-5: Moderate scaffolding (learning Python + SDD, 3-4 options, moderate complexity)
  - Parts 6-8: Minimal scaffolding (advanced topics, multiple options, complex systems)
  - Parts 9-13: Professional level (production deployment, no artificial limits)
- Concepts introduced once, then referenced by name
- Explicit prerequisite chains documented
- No forward references without explanation ("Chapter X covers this")
- Related concepts taught together, not scattered
- Refer to `specs/book/chapter-index.md` for specific progression and `book-scaffolding` skill

---

### Principle 6: Consistent Structure Across All Chapters

All content creators (human authors and AI agents) MUST use the same shared infrastructure (skills, output styles, sub-agents) to ensure consistency.

**Why This Matters:** Consistency in form allows readers to focus on content. It makes chapters replaceable and updatable without cascading changes. Shared infrastructure enables AI and humans to collaborate effectively on content creation.

**What This Means:**

- All chapters follow identical structure (documented in `.claude/output-styles/chapters.md`)
- All lessons follow identical teaching structure (documented in `.claude/output-styles/lesson.md`)
- All Python code follows identical formatting standards (black, mypy --strict)
- All TypeScript code follows identical formatting standards (prettier, tsc --strict)
- All exercises follow identical structure and approach
- All content creators discover and apply skills from `.claude/skills/` contextually
- Cross-chapter consistency verified before publication

---

### Principle 7: Technical Accuracy and Currency (Always Verified)

All technical claims MUST be verified, tool versions current, and best practices demonstrated.

**Why This Matters:** Teaching outdated or incorrect practices wastes reader time and creates bad habits. Accuracy builds trust and sets professional standards. In the rapidly-evolving AI ecosystem, currency is critical.

**What This Means:**

- All Python features verified for 3.13+
- All TypeScript features verified for 5.3+ and ES2024
- All tool instructions tested (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Docker, Kubernetes)
- All external links live and current at publication
- Best practices demonstrated (PEP 8, ESLint, secure coding)
- All technical claims fact-checked and sourced
- Security practices demonstrated (no hardcoded secrets, input validation, secure defaults)
- Update triggers noted for volatile content (AI tools, package versions)

---

### Principle 8: Accessibility and Inclusivity (No Gatekeeping)

Content MUST be welcoming and accessible to diverse learners with varied backgrounds and abilities.

**Why This Matters:** Learners come from all backgrounds. Assumptions exclude people. Clarity benefits everyone. Accessibility is quality, not a feature. The AI-native era democratizes software development—our content should reflect that.

**What This Means:**

- No assumed computer science background (explain jargon on first use)
- No ableist language ("obviously", "simply", "just", "easy")
- Code examples include clear comments explaining intent
- Diverse example names/contexts; gender-neutral language
- Multiple explanation styles: text, code, diagrams, analogies
- Platform-specific instructions where setup differs (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Free/open-source alternatives always provided
- Error literacy: teach distinction between normal output and actual errors

**Error Literacy Additions:**

- Every technical lesson MUST include "Red Flags to Watch" section
- Distinguishes: ✅ Normal/Expected vs. ⚠️ Actual Problems
- Empowers learners: "Error messages are learning tools. When you see ERROR, ask your AI agent"
- Reduces anxiety about terminal output by separating signal from noise

---

### Principle 9: Show-Spec-Validate Pedagogy

Teaching MUST follow specification-first pattern: show spec FIRST, show AI generation, show code, then explain WHAT/HOW/WHY, then show validation.

**Why This Matters:** In AI-native development, code is OUTPUT not INPUT. We must teach the thinking (specification) before showing the result (code). This pattern models the actual AI-native workflow readers will use professionally.

**What This Means:**

- Present specification before code
- Show the AI prompt used to generate code
- Show the generated code
- Describe WHAT the code does (high-level overview)
- Explain HOW it works (step-by-step execution)
- Explain WHY design decisions were made
- Show validation steps (testing, security scanning)
- Show variations and related patterns
- Every chapter includes "Common Mistakes" section
- Every chapter includes "AI Exercise" (starting Ch 3)

**Example Structure:**

```
1. The Specification (what we want to build)
2. The AI Prompt (how we ask AI to build it)
3. The Generated Code (what AI produces)
4. The Explanation (what/how/why it works)
5. The Validation (testing and verification)
6. Try It Yourself (hands-on exercise)
```

---

### Principle 10: Real-World Project Integration

Projects MUST reflect realistic development scenarios with production deployment, not contrived academic exercises.

**Why This Matters:** Toy examples don't transfer to real work. Students need portfolio-worthy projects. Real-world friction (APIs, error handling, deployment, scaling) is learning opportunity, not obstacle. GitHub portfolio is essential for job seekers.

**What This Means:**

- Projects use real tools: git, Docker, Kubernetes, package managers, CI/CD
- File organization matches professional conventions (src/, tests/, .env, Dockerfile, k8s/)
- Projects published to GitHub with README, license, documentation
- Integration with real APIs and data sources (with error handling and fallback strategies)
- **Deployment is NOT optional**: all projects show production deployment path
- Projects span multiple chapters showing iterative development
- Real scalability, security, and cost considerations discussed

**Application:**

- Parts 1-5: Local development with deployment awareness
- Parts 6-9: Agent systems with testing and validation
- Parts 10-13: Full production deployment (Docker, K8s, databases, event-driven architecture)

---

### Principle 11: Tool Diversity and Honest Comparison

Multiple AI tools MUST be covered with honest comparison, not single-tool lock-in.

**Why This Matters:** AI tool landscape evolves rapidly. Teaching one tool creates fragility. Students benefit from understanding trade-offs and having backup options. Tool diversity builds adaptable problem-solving skills. Professional developers choose tools based on context, not hype.

**What This Means:**

- Part 2 (AI Tool Landscape) covers: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Zed
- Each tool's strengths and ideal use cases explained objectively
- Common workflows demonstrated across multiple tools
- Students encouraged to experiment and find personal preferences
- No vendor lock-in language; all tools presented as options with tradeoffs
- Fallback strategies when tools unavailable (rate limits, API changes, service outages)

---

### Principle 12: Cognitive Load Consciousness (Graduated)

Content MUST be deliberately structured to match audience cognitive capacity. Beginners get heavy scaffolding; professionals get realistic complexity.

**Why This Matters:** Beginners (especially non-programmers) have limited working memory. Overwhelming them loses readers. BUT advanced learners need professional-level content. Strategic simplification for beginners, realistic complexity for professionals.

**What This Means:**

**For Beginner Content (Parts 1-3):**

- Max 2 options to choose from (AI agent handles 3+ options)
- Max 5 new concepts per lesson section
- Always show minimal/simplest version first
- One new skill/concept per lesson where possible
- Remove theoretical scenarios and edge cases
- Language: "Your AI agent handles this complexity—you understand the concept"
- Trade-off: Clarity over Comprehensiveness

**For Intermediate Content (Parts 4-5):**

- 3-4 options allowed with guided selection criteria
- 7 concepts per section (more synthesis expected)
- Introduce tradeoffs explicitly
- Expect independent problem-solving with AI assistance

**For Advanced Content (Parts 6-8):**

- No artificial option limits (show ecosystem realistically)
- 10+ concepts per section (synthesis and integration expected)
- Architecture discussions (patterns, anti-patterns)
- Independent research encouraged

**For Professional Content (Parts 9-13):**

- No scaffolding (assumes competence)
- Real-world complexity (security, scale, cost, operations)
- Multiple valid approaches (architectural decisions)
- System thinking, business context, production readiness

---

### Principle 13: Graduated Teaching Pattern (Book → AI Companion → AI Orchestration)

Teaching MUST follow graduated AI-native pattern: **Book teaches foundational concepts** → **AI companion handles complex execution** → **AI orchestration at scale**.

**Why This Matters:** This three-tier pattern makes content future-proof. Foundational concepts are stable (book teaches them directly). Complex execution evolves (AI companion handles it, stays current). Scaling requires automation (AI orchestration, professional workflow). Teaching what doesn't change, delegating what evolves, orchestrating what scales.

**Visual Model:**
```
Level 1: FOUNDATIONAL          Level 2: COMPLEX              Level 3: SCALE
(Book Teaches)                 (AI Companion)                (AI Orchestration)
─────────────────              ────────────────              ──────────────────
│ Markdown: # headers │   →   │ Markdown: tables │      →   │ Convert 100 docs │
│ Git: commit, push   │   →   │ Git: rebase      │      →   │ 10 worktrees     │
│ Python: variables   │   →   │ Python: typing   │      →   │ Project refactor │
│ Docker: concepts    │   →   │ Multi-stage build│      →   │ K8s orchestration│

TEACH what's STABLE        DELEGATE what's COMPLEX      ORCHESTRATE what SCALES
```

**Mapping to Professional Work:**
- **Tier 1** = Human expertise (strategic thinking, domain knowledge, foundational understanding)
- **Tier 2** = AI execution (complex implementation, best practices, syntax mastery)
- **Tier 3** = Orchestration (managing AI agents at scale, workflow automation)

This three-tier pattern prepares you for the actual AI-native workplace, not just academic exercises.

**The Three Tiers:**

**Tier 1: Foundational Concepts (Book Teaches Directly)**
- Stable concepts that won't change over time
- Core syntax, basic commands, fundamental principles
- Direct explanation with analogies and diagrams
- **Example:** Markdown `#` headings, Python variables, git `commit`/`push` concepts

**Student Responsibility:** Read, practice manually to understand, build mental models

**Tier 2: Complex Execution (AI Companion)**
- Complex syntax students shouldn't memorize
- Multi-step operations with evolving best practices
- Student directs (specification), AI executes (implementation), student observes approach
- **Example:** Markdown tables, Docker multi-stage builds, complex git workflows (rebase, worktrees)

**Student Responsibility:** Specify what they want, understand the strategy AI uses (not memorize syntax)

**Tier 3: Scaling & Automation (AI Orchestration)**
- Operations involving 10+ items or multi-file workflows
- Professional automation patterns
- Student orchestrates (strategic direction), AI manages execution (tactical work)
- **Example:** 10 parallel worktrees, batch file conversions, project-wide refactoring

**Student Responsibility:** Direct AI strategically, supervise execution, validate results

**Application Matrix:**

| Content Type | Book Teaches | AI Companion | AI Orchestration |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Markdown** | `#` headings, `**bold**`, `*italic*` | Tables, complex lists | Multi-file document conversion |
| **Git** | `commit`, `push`, `branch` concepts | Worktree setup, rebase workflows | 10+ parallel worktrees |
| **Python** | Variables, functions, basic syntax | Function generation from specs | Project-wide refactoring |
| **Docker** | Container concepts, basic Dockerfile | Multi-stage builds | Multi-service orchestration |

**Teaching Structure by Tier:**

**Tier 1 Example (Markdown Basics):**
```markdown
## Markdown Headings

Use `#` for headings. More `#` = smaller heading:
# Heading 1 (largest)
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

Use `**` for bold and `*` for italic.
```

**Tier 2 Example (Markdown Tables):**
```markdown
## Creating Tables (With AI Companion)

Tables use complex syntax with pipes and alignment. Let your AI handle it.

**Tell your AI:** "Create a markdown table with columns X, Y, Z and 5 rows of data."

**What you learn:** Specification skills (what table you need), not pipe syntax memorization.
```

**Tier 3 Example (Document Conversion):**
```markdown
## Converting Documents (AI Orchestration)

**Tell your AI:** "Convert all 10 Word docs in /documents to markdown with consistent formatting."

**What you learn:** Orchestration mindset—directing AI to automate repetitive work at scale.
```

**Lesson Progression Pattern:**

- **Lesson 1 (Foundation):** Manual practice with core concepts (e.g., open 3 terminals, run commands manually to understand)
- **Lesson 2+ (Scaling):** AI orchestration of complex workflows (e.g., "set up 10 worktrees for parallel development")

**AI's Role Across Tiers:**

- **Tier 1 (Foundational):** Book teaches; AI validates student work and provides practice feedback
- **Tier 2 (Complex Execution):** AI teaches HOW through demonstration; student specifies WHAT they need
- **Tier 3 (Orchestration):** AI teaches patterns through collaboration; student directs strategy

**Important:** AI as "Teacher" (from Three Roles Framework) means demonstrating execution patterns and techniques, NOT replacing the book's explanation of foundational concepts. The three roles (Teacher/Student/Co-Worker) operate contextually based on complexity tier.

**NEVER DO:**
- ❌ Ask students "Ask your AI: What are markdown headings?" (Book should teach stable foundational concepts)
- ❌ Make students manually type complex table syntax (AI companion should handle complexity)
- ❌ Make students set up 10 worktrees manually one-by-one (AI orchestration should automate scale)

**ALWAYS DO:**
- ✅ Book explains foundational concepts clearly and directly with examples
- ✅ "Tell your AI: Create a table with columns X, Y, Z" (specification-driven approach)
- ✅ "Tell your AI: Set up 10 worktrees for features 1-10" (orchestration-driven approach)

---

### Principle 14: Planning-First Development (NEW)

Specification-writing is THE primary skill in AI-native development. Clear, testable specs MUST precede all implementation work.

**Why This Matters:** In traditional coding, you write code manually. In AI-native development, you write specifications and AI generates code. Therefore, specification quality directly determines output quality. Poor specs → broken code. Great specs → working software. Planning IS the work, not prep for the work.

**What This Means:**

- Every project starts with written specification (spec.md)
- Specifications include: requirements, acceptance criteria, constraints, non-goals, dependencies
- AI generation happens ONLY after spec approved by human
- Iterative refinement: spec → generate → test → improve spec → regenerate (NOT manual patching)
- Specifications are versioned, reviewed, and treated as source code
- Planning is not "busywork"—it's the primary value-add of the human developer

**Application:**

- Part 5 (Spec-Driven Development) teaches specification methodology formally
- ALL chapters modeling projects must show spec-first workflow
- Code examples include the specification that produced them
- Students practice writing specs, not just reading them
- Exercises: "Write a specification for X" (not "Write code for X")

---

### Principle 15: Validation-Before-Trust (NEW)

All AI-generated outputs MUST be validated before use. Validation skills are as important as specification skills.

**Why This Matters:** AI can hallucinate, misunderstand requirements, or generate insecure code. Blind trust in AI outputs is dangerous and unprofessional. Professional developers validate everything. In AI-native workflows, validation is the critical safety mechanism.

**What This Means:**

- Read generated code before running it (understand before executing)
- Understand what code does before accepting it
- Test all generated code (unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end)
- Scan for security issues (hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, XSS)
- Verify generated code matches specification
- Ask AI to explain code if unclear
- Iterate on failure: if code doesn't match spec, refine spec and regenerate (NOT manual patching)

**Application:**

- Every code example includes validation steps
- Students practice code reading and comprehension skills
- Testing taught early and reinforced throughout
- Security scanning demonstrated and required
- "Common Mistakes" sections include validation failures
- Part 6+ (Production systems): Lessons teach professional validation checklists as content (NOT as lesson closure elements)

---

### Principle 16: Bilingual Development (Python + TypeScript) (NEW)

Professional AI-native developers MUST be proficient in both Python (reasoning/backend) and TypeScript (interaction/frontend). Both languages receive equal treatment.

**Why This Matters:** Modern AI systems have two layers: Reasoning Layer (Python for agents, data, logic) and Interaction Layer (TypeScript for UIs, real-time, voice). Knowing only one language limits what you can build. Full-stack AI-native development requires bilingual fluency.

**What This Means:**

- Python standards: 3.13+, type hints mandatory, modern syntax (Part 4 chapters - see chapter-index.md)
- TypeScript standards: 5.3+, strict mode, ES2024 target (TypeScript part chapters - see chapter-index.md)
- Students learn specification-writing in both languages
- Code examples demonstrate language-appropriate use cases
- Projects integrate Python backends with TypeScript frontends
- Testing covers both languages
- Deployment includes both runtimes (containerization for both)

**Application:**

- Part 4: Python mastery (see chapter-index.md for chapter list)
- TypeScript part: TypeScript mastery (see chapter-index.md for chapter list)
- Later parts: Integration (realtime agents, voice, full-stack deployment)
- All full-stack projects require both languages

---

### Principle 17: Production-Ready Deployment (NEW)

All projects MUST demonstrate production deployment with cloud-native patterns, not just local development.

**Why This Matters:** "Works on my laptop" is not professional software. AI-native developers must understand containerization, orchestration, state management, and scalability. Deployment is not optional—it's the measure of whether software is actually useful.

**What This Means:**

- Docker containerization for all projects (Containerization part)
- Kubernetes orchestration for multi-service systems (Orchestration part)
- Database integration (PostgreSQL, vector stores) (Database part)
- Event-driven architecture patterns (Kafka, Dapr) (Event-driven part)
- Stateful agent deployment (Dapr actors, workflows) (Stateful agents part)
- CI/CD pipelines and deployment automation
- Monitoring, logging, and observability (structured logging, metrics, tracing)
- Security best practices (secrets management, authentication, authorization)
- Real scalability, reliability, and cost considerations

**Application:**

- Later parts dedicated to production deployment (see chapter-index.md for structure)
- All projects include Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests
- Deployment examples tested and working (not theoretical)
- Real cloud deployment demonstrated
- Professional operational practices (health checks, graceful shutdown, error budgets)

---

### Principle 18: The Three-Role AI Partnership

AI agents simultaneously fulfill three distinct roles in AI-native development, creating a complete learning and working ecosystem.

**Why This Matters:** Understanding these three roles helps students develop appropriate mental models for AI collaboration. AI is not just a tool—it's a partner that teaches, learns, and works alongside you. This multi-role relationship is the foundation of effective AI-native development.

**The Three Roles:**

**🎓 AI as Teacher:**
- Provides instant access to vast knowledge bases and best practices
- Suggests optimal solutions and proven architectural patterns
- Explains code, tradeoffs, and design decisions in detail
- Accelerates learning across domains and technologies
- Answers "why" questions about implementation choices

**When AI Teaches:** Demonstrating complex execution patterns (Tier 2), explaining generated code, suggesting best practices, providing architectural guidance.

**💙 AI as Student:**
- Learns from your domain expertise and business context
- Adapts to your coding style, preferences, and patterns
- Improves through your feedback and corrections
- Understands project-specific requirements and constraints
- Remembers your choices and applies them consistently

**When AI Learns:** Receiving your specifications, incorporating your feedback on generated code, adapting to your architectural preferences, understanding your quality standards.

**🤝 AI as Co-Worker:**
- Collaborates on equal footing (not a subordinate tool)
- Handles implementation details autonomously
- Works 24/7 as tireless partner without breaks
- Complements human strategic thinking with execution speed
- Manages routine tasks while you focus on high-value decisions

**When AI Co-Works:** Generating code from specifications, running tests, refactoring, handling boilerplate, automating repetitive workflows, orchestrating multi-step processes.

**Application in This Book:**

- **Parts 1-3:** Introduce all three roles; emphasize AI as teacher (learning fundamentals)
- **Parts 4-5:** Balance all three roles; AI learns your preferences as you learn Python/SDD
- **Parts 6-8:** Emphasize AI as co-worker; autonomous agent development
- **Parts 9-13:** Professional collaboration; all three roles in production context

**Integration with Graduated Teaching Pattern (Principle 13):**

- **Tier 1 (Foundational):** AI validates and provides practice (limited teaching role)
- **Tier 2 (Complex):** AI teaches execution patterns; learns your specifications
- **Tier 3 (Orchestration):** AI works autonomously; you orchestrate strategically

**Key Insight:** This three-role partnership creates a complete learning ecosystem where knowledge flows bidirectionally, capabilities are complementary, and outcomes exceed what either human or AI could achieve alone. You're not using AI—you're partnering with it.

**What This Means:**

- Every code example should acknowledge which role AI plays
- Students practice all three types of interaction
- Exercises include: asking AI to explain (teacher), providing feedback (student), delegating tasks (co-worker)
- Assessment includes effectiveness of AI collaboration, not just code correctness

---

## II.B Domain Skills Architecture (Plugin-Based)

### Philosophy: Skills as Plugins

Skills are **discovered dynamically** from the `.claude/skills/` directory. This architecture enables:

- Adding new skills without modifying constitution
- Removing obsolete skills without breaking the framework
- Contextual application based on chapter type and requirements
- Framework reusability for different book domains

**Source of Truth**: `.claude/skills/` directory structure and skill metadata

---

### Skill Categories

Skills are organized into categories based on their purpose and applicability:

#### Category 1: Pedagogical Skills (Universal)

**Purpose**: Teaching methodology, learning science, accessibility
**Required for**: All content types
**Activation**: Always active

**Examples**:

- `learning-objectives` — Measurable outcomes aligned with Bloom's taxonomy
- `assessment-builder` — Quizzes, exercises, evaluations
- `technical-clarity` — Clear explanations, jargon management
- `book-scaffolding` — Multi-part content structure, cognitive load
- `content-evaluation-framework` — Quality rubrics

---

#### Category 2: AI-Native Development Skills

**Purpose**: Teaching specification-first, validation-first, AI collaboration
**Required for**: Technical chapters (Parts 4+)
**Activation**: When chapter involves code or specifications

**Examples**:

- `spec-example-generator` — High-quality specification patterns
- `spec-scaffolding` — Progressive specification-writing instruction
- `spec-exercise-designer` — Deliberate practice for spec-writing
- `ai-collaboration-pedagogy` — AI as co-learning partner
- `prompt-engineering-pedagogy` — Effective AI communication
- `validation-pedagogy` — Output validation and safety

---

#### Category 3: Content-Specific Skills

**Purpose**: Language/tool/domain-specific pedagogy
**Required for**: Specific parts or chapters
**Activation**: Based on part/chapter context

**Examples**:

- `typescript-pedagogy` — TypeScript teaching (Part 8+)
- `deployment-pedagogy` — Production deployment (Part 10+)
- `ai-tool-comparison-pedagogy` — Tool selection guidance (Part 2)

---

#### Category 4: Utilities

**Purpose**: Tooling, automation, infrastructure
**Required for**: None (quality of life)
**Activation**: On-demand

**Examples**:

- `docusaurus-deployer` — Build and deployment automation
- `quiz-generator` — Assessment generation utilities
- `skill-creator` — Meta-skill for creating new skills
- `skills-proficiency-mapper` — CEFR/Bloom's proficiency mapping

---

### Skill Discovery Protocol

Subagents discover and apply skills dynamically:

1. **Scan**: Read `.claude/skills/` directory
2. **Filter**: Select skills by category and `required_for` metadata
3. **Contextualize**: Apply additional skills based on chapter type
4. **Execute**: Invoke skills during content creation

**Example Discovery**:

```yaml
# chapter-planner subagent
base_skills:
  - category: pedagogical
  - required_for: [chapter-planner]

contextual_skills:
  - if chapter_type == "technical": add category "ai-native-development"
  - if chapter_part >= 8: add "typescript-pedagogy"
  - if chapter_part >= 10: add "deployment-pedagogy"
```

---

### Skill Metadata Standard

Every skill MUST include YAML frontmatter in `SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: "skill-name"
category: "pedagogical|ai-native|content-specific|utility"
description: "Clear one-line purpose"
applies_to: ["all-chapters"|"technical-chapters"|"part-X"]
required_for: ["chapter-planner"|"lesson-writer"|"technical-reviewer"]
version: "1.0.0"
dependencies: []
---
```

---

### Skill Quality Standards

All skills MUST:

- Include `SKILL.md` with clear purpose and activation triggers
- Provide reference documentation in `reference/` subdirectory
- Include validation scripts (where applicable) in `scripts/` subdirectory
- Specify templates (where applicable) in `templates/` subdirectory
- Declare version and dependencies in frontmatter
- Document which subagents should invoke them

---

### Governance: Flexible Validation

**Instead of**: "All content must use exactly 14 skills"

**Validation checks**:

- [ ] All **pedagogical** skills applied appropriately for chapter type
- [ ] **AI-native** skills applied for technical chapters
- [ ] **Content-specific** skills applied when part/chapter requires them
- [ ] Skill outputs meet quality standards defined in skill documentation
- [ ] No missing skills for declared requirements

**Framework principle**: Content quality depends on **appropriate skill application**, not arbitrary skill counts.

## III. Book Structure

**Authoritative Reference**: `specs/book/chapter-index.md` defines all chapters, their part assignments, titles, key topics, and file names. This is THE definitive source for book structure and implementation status.

**Structural Philosophy** (Progressive Learning Path):

The book follows a progressive structure building from AI-native mindset through production deployment:

1. **Mindset Shift**: Understand AI-native revolution, meet the tools
2. **Communication Skills**: Learn to communicate with AI (prompting, context)
3. **Foundation Languages**: Python for reasoning, TypeScript for interaction
4. **Methodology**: Spec-Driven Development as core workflow
5. **Agent Systems**: Build agentic AI with SDK integration
6. **Production Deployment**: Real-time, voice, containers, orchestration, state

**Progressive Complexity** (Scaffolding Strategy):

- **Early Parts**: Beginner-friendly, maximum scaffolding, 2 options max
- **Middle Parts**: Intermediate, moderate scaffolding, 3-4 options
- **Advanced Parts**: Minimal scaffolding, realistic options, multiple valid approaches
- **Professional Parts**: No artificial limits, production complexity, business context

**Key References**:

- **`specs/book/chapter-index.md`** — Chapter titles, numbers, topics, and **completion status** (✅ = exists, 📋 = planned)
  - Single source of truth for "how many chapters/parts exist"
  - Updates maintained as chapters are added; no need to update constitution
- **`specs/book/directory-structure.md`** — File paths, folder organization (WHERE to put chapters)
- **`book-source/docs/`** — Actual content directory (see structure by example)

---

## IV. Non-Negotiable Rules

### What We ALWAYS Do

✅ **ALWAYS:**

- Write specifications before implementation (spec-first development)
- Validate all AI-generated code before use (read, understand, test)
- Show the specification that produced code examples
- Demonstrate both Python AND TypeScript where appropriate
- Include deployment considerations for production-relevant examples
- Test examples on multiple platforms (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Use modern syntax (Python 3.13+, TypeScript ES2024+, strict modes)
- Provide fallback strategies when AI tools unavailable
- Frame AI as co-learning partner, not just coding assistant
- Teach validation skills alongside specification skills
- Plan ahead using learning sciences and pedagogical principles
- Use specialized skills and subagents to enhance content quality
- Include type hints on every function without exception
- Explain WHY, not just HOW (design decisions and reasoning)
- Provide working code examples with documented expected output
- Include "Common Mistakes" section in every chapter
- Include "AI Exercise" in every chapter (starting Ch 3)
- Validate against this Constitution before publication
- Assume readers know nothing (no gatekeeping)
- Show: specification → AI prompt → generated code → validation
- Encourage iterative refinement with AI tools

### What We NEVER Do

❌ **NEVER:**

- Generate code without a specification
- Trust AI outputs without validation
- Skip testing for "simple" examples
- Assume Python-only is sufficient (bilingual development required)
- Teach local-only development without deployment path
- Present AI as infallible or magical
- Skip security scanning of generated code
- Use deprecated syntax or outdated patterns
- Hardcode configuration (use environment variables)
- Deploy without observability (logging, monitoring, health checks)
- Use vague gatekeeping terms ("easy", "simple", "obvious")
- Include untested or broken code
- Assume reader knowledge or background
- Skip type hints for "simple" functions
- Condescend to readers
- Hardcode secrets, tokens, API keys, passwords
- Make technical claims without verification
- Publish without human review
- Leave placeholder text or TODOs in published chapters
- Contradict earlier chapters without explicit explanation
- Present single AI tool as mandatory

### When to Escalate for Human Decision

**Always flag for human judgment when:**

- Breaking changes in Python/TypeScript/tool versions
- Significant methodology shifts affecting prior chapters
- Content contradicts earlier chapters
- Uncertain or debatable technical claims
- Accessibility concerns
- Copyright or attribution issues
- Major style/voice inconsistencies
- Security vulnerabilities or risks
- Deployment architecture decisions
- Production readiness concerns

## V. Development Workflow

### The Spec-Driven Development Loop (What We Teach)

All content development MUST model the SDD loop we're teaching readers:

```
Problem/Idea
    ↓
Human + AI → Write Specification (spec.md)
    ↓ (iterate until spec is clear and testable)
Approved Specification
    ↓
AI Agent → Generate Implementation
    ↓
Human → Validate Output (read, test, verify)
    ↓
    Pass? → Deploy
    Fail? → Refine Spec → Regenerate
```

**Key Principle**: We teach readers to think in specifications, collaborate with AI on implementation, and validate rigorously. Our own workflow MUST model this.

### Our Meta-Application: Creating Book Content

When creating book chapters, we apply the same loop:

**Phase 1: SPECIFY** (Human + Main Claude)

- **Input**: Source material, chapter topic, learning goals, target audience tier
- **Process**: Collaborative specification writing
- **Output**: `specs/part-X/chapter-Y-spec.md`
- **Acceptance**: Spec is clear, testable, approved by human

**Phase 2: PLAN** (chapter-planner subagent)

- **Input**: Approved specification
- **Process**: Break spec into lesson plans and task checklist
- **Output**: `specs/part-X/chapter-Y-plan.md`, `specs/part-X/chapter-Y-tasks.md`
- **Acceptance**: Plan is detailed, tasks are actionable, complexity tier appropriate

**Phase 3: IMPLEMENT** (lesson-writer subagent)

- **Input**: Plan and tasks
- **Process**: Write lesson content using 14 domain skills, appropriate output styles
- **Output**: `docs/part-X/chapter-Y/index.md` + lesson files
- **Acceptance**: Content follows plan, uses correct complexity tier, models spec-first workflow

**Phase 4: VALIDATE** (technical-reviewer + spec-reviewer + prompt-validator)

- **Input**: Complete chapter content
- **Process**: Validate against spec, constitution, quality standards
- **Output**: Validation report with pass/fail + issues categorized (critical/major/minor)
- **Acceptance**: All critical issues resolved, chapter meets quality gates

**Phase 5: DEPLOY** (Human final review → merge to main → Docusaurus build)

- **Input**: Validated chapter
- **Process**: Human editorial polish → publish
- **Output**: Live chapter on website (https://ai-native.panaversity.org)
- **Acceptance**: Builds cleanly, no broken links, renders correctly

### Quality Gates

Each phase includes:

- **Entry criteria**: What must exist before starting
- **Exit criteria**: What must be true before advancing
- **Validation**: How to verify quality
- **Iteration**: When to return to previous phase vs advance

**Critical Principle**: If validation fails, we improve the SPECIFICATION and regenerate, rather than manually patching the output. This models the spec-driven workflow we teach.

## VI. Infrastructure

### Domain Skills (Plugin-Based Discovery)

All content creators MUST apply skills contextually from `.claude/skills/` directory as defined in Section II.B.

**Skill Discovery**: Subagents scan `.claude/skills/` directory and apply skills based on:

- Category (pedagogical, ai-native, content-specific, utility)
- Chapter type (conceptual, technical, hybrid)
- Part requirements (TypeScript for Part 8+, deployment for Part 10+)
- Subagent needs (declared in subagent metadata)

**No Hardcoded Lists**: Skills are plugins. Adding/removing skills does not require constitution changes.

**Note**: Skills directory requires update to align with v3.0.0 (separate feature).

### Output Styles (Format Specifications)

All content MUST conform to output styles located in `.claude/output-styles/`:

1. **chapters.md** — Chapter structure and Docusaurus frontmatter format
2. **lesson.md** — Individual lesson section formatting and teaching structure

These are **generic, reusable templates** applicable to any educational content project.

### Sub-Agents (Orchestrators)

Three specialized agents manage the SDD loop phases (located in `.claude/agents/`):

1. **chapter-planner** — Takes approved spec → creates detailed lesson plans and task checklists
2. **lesson-writer** — Takes lesson plan → writes complete lesson content with contextually appropriate skills applied
3. **technical-reviewer** — Takes completed chapter → validates technical accuracy, pedagogical effectiveness, and constitutional alignment

**Note**: Subagents discover available skills dynamically from `.claude/skills/` directory.

## VII. Governance

### This Constitution's Authority

- **Source of Truth:** Supreme governing document for all book project decisions
- **Precedence:** All specifications, skills, output styles, and sub-agents must align with this Constitution
- **Enforcement:** All chapters validated against this Constitution before publication

### Amendment Process

**For Small Changes** (clarifications, wording):

- Make changes directly with commit message referencing this Constitution
- Increment PATCH version only

**For Significant Changes** (new principles, removed requirements, major redefinitions):

- Document rationale in commit message or linked ADR
- Update VERSION field
- Increment MAJOR or MINOR per semantic versioning
- Review all dependent templates and chapters for alignment
- Update "Last Amended" date
- Create migration guide for breaking changes

**For Proposals:**

1. Document the current problem or gap
2. Propose specific change to Constitution text
3. Justify with rationale (pedagogical, technical, practical)
4. Identify affected chapters and templates
5. Seek review and approval before implementing

### Compliance Verification

- **AI Agents** verify Constitutional alignment in outputs before handoff
- **Human Reviewer** confirms adherence before publication
- **Automated Checks** enforce standards where possible (mypy --strict, black, prettier, tsc --strict, Docusaurus build)
