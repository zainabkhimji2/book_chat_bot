# Part 1 Fact-Checking Protocol

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-01-11
**Purpose**: Systematic verification of all factual claims in Part 1: Introducing AI-Driven Development

---

## Context

You are auditing Part 1 of the "AI-Native Software Development" book for factual accuracy. Hallucinations and fabricated statistics undermine credibility, so every claim must be verified against authoritative sources.

**Previous Audit Results** (Introduction - README.md):
- ✅ Bereket Engida / Better Auth story verified (TechCrunch 2025)
- ✅ AI models (GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, Gemini 2.5) verified as real 2025 releases
- ✅ ICPC 2025: OpenAI 12/12 perfect score verified
- ✅ Stack Overflow 2025: 84% using AI tools, 51% daily - verified
- ⚠️ Google adoption: Corrected from 95% to 90% (DORA report)
- ✅ Claude Code $500M ARR verified (Anthropic official)
- ✅ Gemini CLI 1M developers verified
- ✅ OpenAI Codex 70% more PRs verified (DevDay 2025)
- ✅ GDPval benchmark verified
- ✅ Qwen Code verified
- ⚠️ $3T developer economy: Clarified as 30M developers × $100K-$130K value (conservative estimate, actually reasonable)
- ✅ Instagram: 13 employees, $1B acquisition verified
- ✅ WhatsApp: 55 employees, $19B acquisition verified

## Your Task

Audit one of the following chapters for factual accuracy:

- **Chapter 1**: `/book-source/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/01-ai-development-revolution/`
- **Chapter 2**: `/book-source/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/02-ai-turning-point/`
- **Chapter 3**: `/book-source/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/03-billion-dollar-ai/`

## Systematic Audit Process

### Phase 1: Identification (10-15 minutes)

1. **Read the chapter README.md first** to understand the chapter structure
2. **List all lesson files** in the chapter directory using Glob
3. **Extract all factual claims** from each lesson:
   - Statistics and percentages
   - Dollar amounts and financial figures
   - Company names and product names
   - Historical dates and events
   - Survey results and research findings
   - Performance metrics and benchmarks
   - Case studies and examples
   - Technical specifications

4. **Create a claims inventory** using TodoWrite:
   ```
   - Claim description
   - Location (file:line)
   - Status: pending/verified/corrected/removed
   ```

### Phase 2: Verification (30-45 minutes)

For each claim, systematically verify using:

1. **Web Search** for:
   - Official company announcements
   - Research reports (Gartner, IDC, Forrester, Evans Data)
   - Academic papers and peer-reviewed studies
   - Major tech news sources (TechCrunch, VentureBeat, The Verge)
   - Government statistics (BLS, Census Bureau)
   - Official surveys (Stack Overflow, JetBrains, GitHub)

2. **Verification Standards**:
   - ✅ **VERIFIED**: Found in 2+ authoritative sources with exact or near-exact numbers
   - ⚠️ **NEEDS CORRECTION**: Found but numbers/details are inaccurate
   - ❌ **CANNOT VERIFY**: No authoritative sources found
   - 🔄 **REQUIRES CLARIFICATION**: Found but needs additional context or nuance

3. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - Record source URLs for all verified claims
   - Note the exact figures from sources
   - Document any discrepancies between book and sources
   - Flag any suspicious or potentially fabricated claims

### Phase 3: Correction (15-30 minutes)

1. **For NEEDS CORRECTION claims**:
   - Use Edit tool to update with verified information
   - Add source attribution where appropriate
   - Ensure the correction maintains narrative flow

2. **For CANNOT VERIFY claims**:
   - **Option A**: Replace with verified alternative
   - **Option B**: Remove claim entirely
   - **Option C**: Reframe as hypothetical/illustrative (if pedagogically valuable)
   - Document the decision rationale

3. **For REQUIRES CLARIFICATION claims**:
   - Add necessary context
   - Include caveats or qualifications
   - Update wording to be more precise

### Phase 4: Reporting (5-10 minutes)

Create a summary report with:
- Total claims audited
- Verified claims count
- Corrections made
- Claims removed
- High-priority issues flagged

## Claim Categories to Watch

### High-Risk Categories (Often Fabricated)

1. **Specific revenue/funding numbers** for startups
   - ⚠️ Verify acquisition amounts, funding rounds, ARR figures
   - Common issue: Mixing up millions/billions, or citing unannounced figures

2. **Survey statistics** with precise percentages
   - ⚠️ Verify survey year, sample size, exact wording
   - Common issue: Citing "2025 survey" when data is from 2024 or earlier

3. **Product names and model versions**
   - ⚠️ Verify exact product names, version numbers, release dates
   - Common issue: Using future versions that don't exist yet

4. **Performance benchmarks** and competition results
   - ⚠️ Verify competition names, dates, exact scores
   - Common issue: Inflating or misrepresenting results

5. **Market size projections**
   - ⚠️ Distinguish between current market size vs. future projections
   - Common issue: Using 2030/2033 projections as current 2025 figures

6. **Case studies** of individuals or companies
   - ⚠️ Verify names, companies, specific achievements
   - Common issue: Composite/fictional examples presented as real

### Lower-Risk Categories (Usually Accurate)

1. **General trends** and directional statements
2. **Technical concepts** and terminology
3. **Historical background** (pre-2023 established facts)
4. **Pedagogical examples** clearly marked as hypothetical

## Verification Resources

### Primary Sources (Highest Authority)
- Company official blogs and press releases
- SEC filings (for public companies)
- Peer-reviewed academic papers
- Government statistical agencies

### Secondary Sources (High Authority)
- TechCrunch, VentureBeat, The Verge, Ars Technica
- Gartner, IDC, Forrester reports
- Stack Overflow, GitHub, JetBrains official surveys
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Google official announcements

### Tertiary Sources (Use with Caution)
- Medium articles (verify claims independently)
- Aggregator sites (check original sources)
- Blog posts and opinion pieces (distinguish opinion from fact)

### Red Flags
- ❌ No source found with Google search
- ❌ Only found in AI-generated Medium articles
- ❌ Numbers that are suspiciously round (e.g., exactly 50%, exactly $100M)
- ❌ "Studies show" without citation
- ❌ Claims about unreleased products/versions

## Example Workflow

```markdown
## Auditing Chapter 2: AI Turning Point

### Lesson 01: Summer 2025 Inflection Point

**Claim 1**: "Claude Sonnet 4.5 achieved 96.7% on SWE-bench Verified"
- Location: `02-capability-milestones.md:45`
- Search: "Claude Sonnet 4.5 SWE-bench Verified 96.7%"
- Found: Anthropic official blog post (Oct 2025)
- Status: ✅ VERIFIED
- Source: https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5

**Claim 2**: "Acme Corp reduced development time by 10x"
- Location: `03-enterprise-adoption.md:112`
- Search: "Acme Corp AI development 10x faster"
- Found: No results
- Status: ❌ CANNOT VERIFY
- Action: Replace with verified case study (e.g., Duolingo, Cognition Labs)
```

## Special Instructions

1. **Use TodoWrite** to track progress through the chapter
2. **Work systematically**: Complete one lesson file before moving to the next
3. **Batch your searches**: If search is temporarily unavailable, queue claims and verify in batches
4. **Preserve narrative flow**: When correcting, maintain the pedagogical intent
5. **Flag ambiguity**: If a claim seems suspicious but you can't definitively disprove it, flag for human review
6. **Document sources**: Every correction needs a verifiable source URL

---

## Quality Standards

- **Zero tolerance for fabricated statistics**: Remove if unverifiable
- **Strict sourcing**: Prefer official sources over blog posts
- **Recency matters**: Distinguish 2024 vs 2025 data
- **Precision matters**: "Approximately 84%" is better than "over 80%" if source says 84%
- **Attribution matters**: "Stack Overflow 2025 survey" is better than "recent survey"

## Starting Your Audit

**To begin, say**:

> "I will audit Chapter [X]: [Chapter Name]. Let me start by reading the chapter README and listing all lesson files."

Then follow the four-phase process systematically.

**Good luck, and thank you for ensuring this book's credibility!** 📚✅
