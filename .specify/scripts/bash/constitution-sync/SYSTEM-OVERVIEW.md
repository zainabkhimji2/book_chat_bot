# /sp.constitution-sync System Overview

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Created**: 2025-01-10
**Philosophy**: AI-centric intelligent hybrid approach (per-lesson decisions, not mode flags)

---

## The Big Picture

`/sp.constitution-sync` is an **AI-driven constitution propagation system** that intelligently updates existing chapters to comply with new/updated constitutional rules.

**Key Innovation**: Per-lesson intelligence—AI decides for each lesson whether to:
- **Skip** (100% compliant)
- **Surgical Edit** (90%+ compliant, minor fixes)
- **Enhanced Regeneration** (60-89% compliant, preserve quality + fix issues)
- **Full Regeneration** (<60% compliant, fundamental problems)

**Philosophy**: Right tool for each lesson (not one-size-fits-all mode).

---

## Distinction: Error Analysis vs Constitution-Sync

### Error Analysis (`/sp.error-analysis`)
- **Purpose**: Diagnose workflow issues (what went wrong in generation?)
- **Trigger**: After workflow execution (reactive)
- **Input**: Executed artifacts (PHR, specs, lessons, validation reports)
- **Output**: Diagnostic report + recommendations
- **Action**: Human fixes **workflow** (prompts, commands, processes)
- **Timing**: Post-mortem (after chapter generated)
- **Scope**: Single execution trace

### Constitution-Sync (`/sp.constitution-sync`)
- **Purpose**: Update existing content to comply with new rules
- **Trigger**: After constitution changes (proactive maintenance)
- **Input**: Constitution delta + existing chapters
- **Output**: Updated chapters (edited/regenerated)
- **Action**: System automatically modifies **content** (files)
- **Timing**: Maintenance (after constitution updated)
- **Scope**: All existing chapters

**Relationship**: They're complementary—error analysis can debug constitution-sync itself (if sync has issues, run error analysis on sync execution to diagnose workflow problems).

### AI Agent Executes

#### **Phase 0: Constitution Delta Analysis**

```
Reading constitution v3.1.2...
  ✓ Extracted 18 core principles
  ✓ Extracted CoLearning element requirements (💬🎓🚀✨)
  ✓ Extracted Lesson Closure Pattern ("Try With AI" only)
  ✓ Extracted Three-Role AI Partnership requirements

Analyzing what changed (from Sync Impact Report):
  → v3.1.2: Added "Specs Are the New Syntax" tagline
  → v3.1.1: Added LAMs context (LLM vs LAM distinction)
  → v3.1.0: Aligned with presentation, added Three-Role Framework
  → v3.0.2: Redesigned Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching Pattern)

Categorizing rules by impact:
  **High Impact**: CoLearning elements, Lesson closure, Pedagogical ordering, Three-Role Partnership
  **Medium Impact**: Graduated Teaching, Cognitive load, Tone/style, Spec-first pedagogy
  **Low Impact**: Python 3.13+, Type hints, Reading level

Expected violations for Chapter 14:
  → CoLearning elements likely missing (added in v3.1.0)
  → Lesson closure may have post-sections (tightened in v3.0.0)
  → Three-Role Partnership may be weak (added in v3.1.0)
```

**Output**: Context Summary

---

#### **Phase 1: Spec/Plan Compliance Check**

```
Running artifact-locator.sh...
  ✓ Found spec: specs/part-4-chapter-14/spec.md
  ✓ Found plan: specs/part-4-chapter-14/plan.md
  ✓ Found 5 lessons: 01-intro.md through 05-capstone.md

Checking spec.md compliance...
  ✓ Learning objectives aligned
  ✓ Prerequisites explicit
  ✓ Success criteria measurable
  ✓ Evals defined with business-goal connection

Checking plan.md compliance...
  ✓ Lesson breakdown matches spec
  ⚠️ Skills proficiency metadata (CEFR levels) not present
  ⚠️ CoLearning elements not referenced in plan

**Decision**: Plan needs minor update

Applying plan fixes...
  ├─ Adding CEFR proficiency levels to lesson objectives
  ├─ Adding CoLearning elements guidance per lesson
  └─ Updated plan.md (2 minutes)

✅ Spec/Plan now compliant, proceeding to per-lesson analysis
```

AI reading lesson content...
  ✓ Content quality: Good (core examples solid)
  ⚠️ Pedagogical ordering violations (uses len() and .split() without introduction)
  ⚠️ Tone issues in sections (documentation style, not conversational)
  ⚠️ CoLearning elements sparse (1/4 types present)

AI reading violation contexts...

  Line 234 context:
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    print(f"Total: {len(numbers)}")  # No explanation of len()

  **AI Judgment**: CRITICAL - beginner doesn't know len() yet

  Line 289 context:
    data = "1,2,3,4,5"
    values = data.split(",")  # No explanation of methods

  **AI Judgment**: CRITICAL - string methods not introduced until Chapter 15

**Compliance: 65%** (structural + pedagogical issues, good content)

Decision Matrix:
  - Compliance: 65% (within 60-90% range)
  - Content Quality: Good (examples worth preserving)
  - Violations: Mixed (structural + pedagogical ordering)
  - Multiple sections need rewriting? YES

**Decision: ENHANCED REGENERATION** (12 minutes estimated)

Rationale:
  - Content quality good (examples solid, worth preserving)
  - Multiple issue types (not just structural)
  - Pedagogical ordering violations require content restructuring
  - Tone issues in several sections (not just insertions)

Execution:

  Extracting quality content...
    ✓ Example 1 (integer operations): Excellent, preserve
    ✓ Example 3 (float precision): Excellent, preserve
    ✓ Explanation of numeric types: Good tone, preserve
    ⚠️ Section on "Type Conversions" (lines 220-250): Has len() violation, regenerate
    ⚠️ Paragraphs 5-8 (lines 180-210): Documentation tone, regenerate
    ⚠️ Section on "Working with Numbers" (lines 280-310): Has .split() violation, regenerate

  Reading spec/plan for authoritative guidance...
    Learning Objective: "Understand integer and float types"
    Concepts: Basic arithmetic, division (/ vs //), float precision
    NOT in scope: Type conversions (defer to Chapter 16), string parsing

  Generating enhanced lesson...
    Using lesson-writer skill with:
      ├─ Preserved examples (3 examples)
      ├─ Preserved explanations (2 sections)
      ├─ Constitution constraints (no forward refs, CoLearning elements throughout)
      ├─ Tone guidance (conversational, exploration-focused)
      └─ Pedagogical ordering (only Chapters 1-14 concepts)

  Generated: 02-integers-and-floats.md (enhanced version)

  Diff Summary:
    Preserved: 60% of original content (quality maintained)
    Regenerated: 40% (compliance fixed)
    Added: 8 CoLearning elements
    Fixed: 2 pedagogical ordering violations
    Fixed: 4 tone/style issues

  }

AI reading lesson content...
  ❌ Content quality: Poor (feels like API reference, not learning material)
  ❌ Critical pedagogical violations throughout (uses iteration, methods, comprehensions)
  ❌ Tone: Heavy documentation style (lists features without exploration)
  ❌ Concept misinterpreted: Teaches collection USAGE, should teach AWARENESS
  ❌ Lesson closure violation: "What's Next" section after "Try With AI"
  ❌ No CoLearning elements (0/4)

AI reading spec/plan for intended scope...
  Learning Objective: "Understand that Python has collection types"
  Scope: Collections AWARENESS only (what they are, recognize syntax)
  NOT in scope: Iteration (Chapter 17), methods (Chapter 18), comprehensions (Chapter 22)

Calculating compliance score...
  CoLearning Elements: 0% ❌ (weight: 25)
  Lesson Closure: 0% ❌ (post-section present) (weight: 20)
  Pedagogical Ordering: 10% ❌ (15 critical violations) (weight: 20)
  Three-Role Partnership: 0% ❌ (weight: 15)
  Graduated Teaching: 20% ❌ (weight: 10)
  Tone & Style: 30% ❌ (weight: 5)
  Code Quality: 100% ✅ (weight: 5)

**Compliance: 35%** (fundamental issues throughout)

Decision Matrix:
  - Compliance: 35% (below 60% threshold)
  - Content Quality: Poor (misinterprets learning objectives)
  - Violations: Pervasive (critical pedagogical violations throughout)
  - Concept misunderstood? YES

**Decision: FULL REGENERATION** (18 minutes estimated)

Rationale:
  - Compliance < 60% (fundamental issues)
  - Multiple critical pedagogical violations (blocks learning)
  - Tone issues pervasive (not isolated)
  - Learning objective misinterpreted (teaches usage, should teach awareness)
  - Content not worth preserving (would require complete restructuring anyway)

Execution:

  Reading spec/plan for authoritative guidance...
    Learning Objective: "Understand that Python has collection types (list, dict, tuple, set)"
    Scope: AWARENESS only
      → What collections exist
      → Recognize syntax when you see it
      → Know when to ask AI about collections
    NOT in scope:
      → Iteration (Chapter 17)
      → Methods (Chapter 18)
      → Deep manipulation

  Generating new lesson from scratch...
    Using lesson-writer skill with strict constraints:
      ├─ Constitution-compliant structure
      ├─ CoLearning elements throughout
      ├─ NO iteration (just show static examples)
      ├─ NO methods (just show syntax)
      ├─ Conversational tone (exploration-focused)
      └─ AI partnership emphasized (Three-Role Framework)

  Generated: 04-collections-awareness.md (new version)

  Key Changes:
    Removed: 15+ code examples with iteration/methods
    Added: 6 simple static examples (what collections look like)
    Added: 12 CoLearning elements (4/4 types present)
    Fixed: All 15 pedagogical ordering violations
    Fixed: Lesson closure (removed "What's Next" section)
    Restructured: From API reference to learning narrative

  Validation: Running technical-reviewer...
    ✅ PASS (Fundamental issues resolved)

✅ Lesson 4 updated: Full regeneration (18 minutes)

Decision Matrix:
  - Compliance: 92% (above 90% threshold)
  - Content Quality: Excellent
  - Violations: Single structural issue (post-section)
  - Can fix with simple deletion? YES

**Decision: SURGICAL EDIT** (2 minutes estimated)

Rationale:
  - Excellent content overall (preserve everything)
  - Single violation (post-section after "Try With AI")
  - Surgical removal of 18 lines solves it

Execution:

  Locating post-section...
    Section: "## Completion Checklist" (lines 678-695)
    Location: After "## Try With AI" (line 655)

  Deleting post-section via Edit tool...
    old_string: [entire "Completion Checklist" section text]

#### **Phase 4: Summary Report**

```markdown
# ✅ CONSTITUTION SYNC COMPLETE: Chapter 14

## Executive Summary

**Total Time**: 46 minutes
**Approach**: Intelligent hybrid (per-lesson decisions)
**Constitution Version**: 3.1.2

## Constitution Changes Applied

**What Changed**:
- v3.1.2: Added "Specs Are the New Syntax" tagline
- v3.1.1: Added LAMs context (LLM vs LAM distinction)
- v3.1.0: Aligned with presentation, added Three-Role Framework
- v3.0.2: Redesigned Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching Pattern)

**Impact on This Chapter**:
- CoLearning elements (💬🎓🚀✨) required throughout (added v3.1.0)
- Three-Role AI Partnership must be demonstrated (added v3.1.0)
- Lesson closure strictly "Try With AI" only (tightened v3.0.0)
- Pedagogical ordering enforced (longstanding, but violations found)

## Per-Lesson Breakdown

| Lesson | Compliance | Decision | Time | Changes |
|--------|-----------|----------|------|---------|
| Lesson 1 | 72% | Surgical Edit | 8 min | 15 insertions (CoLearning elements) |
| Lesson 2 | 65% | Enhanced Regen | 12 min | 40% regenerated, 60% preserved |
| Lesson 3 | 100% | No Change | 1 min | Validation only |
| Lesson 4 | 35% | Full Regen | 18 min | Complete rewrite (fundamental issues) |
| Lesson 5 | 92% | Surgical Edit | 2 min | 1 deletion (post-section removal) |

**Total**: 5 lessons, 46 minutes

## Why This Was Optimal

**vs All Surgical Edit** (theoretical Mode 2):
- Would have attempted to fix Lesson 4 with insertions
- Would have missed fundamental pedagogical violations
- Quality: Lower (Lesson 4 still broken)
- Time: ~40 min (saved 6 min) BUT Lesson 4 still fails validation

**vs All Regenerate** (theoretical Mode 3):
- Would have regenerated excellent Lessons 1, 3, 5
- Would have discarded quality content unnecessarily
- Quality: Risk losing existing excellence
- Time: ~2-3 hours (saved 1.5-2.5 hours!)

**Intelligent Hybrid**:
- Each lesson got exactly what it needed
- Lesson 1: Surgical edit (minor fixes, preserve quality)
- Lesson 2: Enhanced regen (preserve examples, fix violations)
- Lesson 3: Skip (already perfect)
- Lesson 4: Full regen (fundamental issues, not worth preserving)
- Lesson 5: Surgical edit (single deletion)
- Quality: Maximized (preserve good, fix bad)
- Time: 46 minutes (optimal efficiency)

## Constitution Compliance

✅ **All 18 principles verified compliant**
✅ CoLearning elements (100% coverage, 4/4 types in all lessons)
✅ Lesson closure pattern (100% compliant, no post-sections)
✅ Pedagogical ordering (no forward references)
✅ Three-Role Partnership (demonstrated throughout)
✅ Graduated Teaching Pattern (Tiers 1-3 present)
✅ Cognitive Load (A1 limits respected)

## Recommendation

Chapter 14 is now constitution-compliant and ready for publication.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Review changes**: Run `git diff` to see what was modified
2. **Test Docusaurus build**: Ensure no broken links or rendering issues
3. **Commit changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Constitution sync: Chapter 14 (intelligent hybrid)

   - Lesson 1: Surgical edit (added 15 CoLearning elements)
   - Lesson 2: Enhanced regen (preserved quality, fixed violations)
   - Lesson 3: No change (already compliant)
   - Lesson 4: Full regen (fundamental pedagogical issues)
   - Lesson 5: Surgical edit (removed post-section)

   All lessons now comply with Constitution v3.1.2"
   ```
4. **Process next chapter**:
   ```bash
   /sp.constitution-sync 15
   ```

## Decision Points

**What would you like to do?**
1. Review changes before committing?

| **Quality** | ⚠️ Misses deep issues | ⚠️ Loses existing quality | ✅ **Optimal** |
| **Risk** | ⚠️ Some lessons still broken | ⚠️ May introduce new issues | ✅ **Minimal** |
| **Efficiency** | ⚠️ Surgical on unfixable | ⚠️ Regen on excellent | ✅ **Right tool per lesson** |

**Why Intelligent Hybrid Wins**:
- Surgical edit on minor issues (fast, preserve quality)
- Enhanced regen on mixed issues (best of both worlds)
- Full regen on fundamental issues (deep fix when needed)
- Skip on compliant lessons (no unnecessary work)

**Real-World Impact**:
- **Lesson 1**: 8 min surgical vs. 20 min regen (saved 12 min, preserved quality)
- **Lesson 3**: 1 min skip vs. 20 min regen (saved 19 min, prevented quality loss)
- **Lesson 4**: 18 min full regen (necessary, surgical would have failed)
- **Total**: 46 min vs. 100 min (all regen) = **54% time savings** + quality maximization

## Key Differentiators

### vs. Manual Review & Update

| Manual Review | /sp.constitution-sync |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Time-intensive (hours per chapter) | Quick triage + intelligent fixes (46 min) |
| Inconsistent criteria | Constitutional principles (18 rules) |
| No pattern detection | Identifies systemic issues |
| Limited scope | Comprehensive (all rules, all lessons) |
| Human error-prone | AI consistency + human oversight |

### vs. Blind Regeneration

| Blind Regeneration | /sp.constitution-sync |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Loses existing quality | Preserves quality where possible |
| No content analysis | Intelligent per-lesson assessment |
| One-size-fits-all | Right tool per lesson |
| 2-3 hours per chapter | 30-60 min average |
| Risk of regression | Validation at every step |

### vs. Error Analysis

| Error Analysis | Constitution-Sync |
|---------------|------------------|
| Diagnoses workflow | Fixes content |
| Read-only | Write operations |
| Post-mortem | Proactive maintenance |
| Report + recommendations | Automated updates |
| Reactive | Proactive |

**They're complementary**: Error analysis improves workflows, constitution-sync maintains content quality.

## Success Metrics

**Quality Gates**:
- ✅ All 18 constitutional principles verified compliant
- ✅ CoLearning elements present in all lessons (4 types)
- ✅ Lesson closure pattern correct (no post-sections)
- ✅ Pedagogical ordering maintained (no forward references)
- ✅ Three-Role Partnership demonstrated
- ✅ Content quality maximized (preserve good, fix bad)

**Efficiency Metrics**:
- ✅ Per-lesson time: 1 min (skip) to 20 min (full regen)
- ✅ Chapter time: 30-60 min average (vs. 2-3 hours all-regen)
- ✅ Quality preserved where possible (vs. blind regeneration)
- ✅ 50%+ time savings vs. all-regeneration approach

**Output Quality**:
- ✅ Intelligent decisions (context-aware, not mechanical)
- ✅ Narrative report (explains reasoning, not just actions)
- ✅ Strategic partnership (decision points, not dictation)
- ✅ Per-lesson rationale (transparency in decision-making)

## Maintenance & Evolution

### Adding New Constitutional Rules

When constitution is updated with new rules:

1. **Update command file**: Add new rule to Phase 0 (delta analysis) and Phase 2 (per-lesson checks)
2. **Update compliance scoring**: Add weight for new rule in compliance calculation
3. **Update helper scripts**: If quantitative detection possible (e.g., count new element type)
4. **Test on existing chapter**: Verify new rule detected and fixed correctly
5. **Document change**: Update SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md with new rule handling

**Example**: If Principle 19 added (new requirement):
- Phase 0: Add to High/Medium/Low impact categorization
- Phase 2: Add to per-lesson check (Step 2.2, rule-by-rule)
- Scoring: Add weight to compliance calculation
- Scripts: Create detection pattern if quantifiable
- Test: Run on Chapter 14, verify detection and fix

### Updating Detection Heuristics

When false positives/negatives occur:

1. **Observe patterns**: Which violations are missed or incorrectly flagged?
2. **Refine scripts**: Update detection patterns in `detect-forward-references.sh` or `compliance-metrics.sh`
3. **Update AI judgment logic**: Improve context interpretation in command file
4. **Test on problematic chapters**: Verify improvements
5. **Document findings**: Update README with lessons learned

**Example**: If `.format()` string method causing false positives:
- Script: Refine pattern to exclude `.format()` from "string methods not introduced"
- AI logic: Add context check "is .format() explained inline?"
- Test: Re-run on chapters with `.format()` usage
- Document: Update README with pattern refinement

### Constitutional Updates

When constitution changes:

1. **Update command file** Phase 0 references (constitution version, change log)
2. **Update evaluation criteria** Phase 2 checks (new/updated rules)
3. **Update expected ranges** in scripts if needed (e.g., new element type counts)
4. **Test on sample chapter** before batch processing
5. **Document migration path** (which chapters affected, what changes expected)

## Credits & Philosophy

**Design Principles**:
1. **AI intelligence at core** (scripts provide data, AI judges)
2. **Per-lesson intelligence** (right intervention per lesson)
3. **Content quality preservation** (when possible)
4. **Constitutional alignment** (all 18 principles)
5. **Narrative partnership** (explain reasoning, offer choices)

**Inspired By**:
- /sp.error-analysis (AI-centric analysis pattern)
- Constitution v3.1.2 (18 principles, co-learning paradigm)
- Andrew Ng's Error Analysis (trace examination + HLP benchmarking)
- Intelligent hybrid approach (optimize per-lesson, not per-chapter mode)

**Built With**:
- AI agent intelligence (context-aware judgments)
- Bash helper scripts (quantitative metrics)
- JSON structured data (parseable outputs)
- Markdown narrative reports (human-readable)
- Edit tool (surgical modifications)
- lesson-writer skill (enhanced/full regeneration)
