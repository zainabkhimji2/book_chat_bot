## 🎯 Your First Steps

### Step 1: Read the CoWriter Guide (30 minutes)

```bash
# Open the guide
cat docs/COWRITER-GUIDE.md
# Or open in your editor
code docs/COWRITER-GUIDE.md
```

**Key sections**:
- Quick Start: Your First Chapter
- Evals-First Methodology (NEW in constitution v3.0.1)
- Working with the Orchestration Layer
- Onboarding Domain Experts

### Step 2: Choose Your Path

**Path A: Create New Chapter** (Recommended for learning)
- Pick a chapter from chapter-index.md that's marked 📋 Planned
- Follow CoWriter Guide Quick Start
- Time: ~8-12 hours for first chapter

**Path B: Redesign Existing Chapter** (Fix old work)
- Pick from 14 implemented chapters
- Use Essential Tasks Guide
- Run technical-reviewer to identify issues
- Time: ~4-5 hours for repair, ~8-12 hours for complete redesign

### Step 3: Set Up Your Branch

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b chapter-X-your-topic

# Verify you have latest infrastructure
git log --oneline -5
# Should show: "Merge pull request #52..."
```

## 🔄 The SDD Workflow (Refresher)

```
Phase 0.5: Evals Definition ✨ NEW
    ↓ Define success criteria (business-goal-aligned)
Phase 1: Specification
    ↓ Write chapter spec (human approval required)
Phase 2: Planning
    ↓ Use chapter-planner subagent
Phase 2.5: Tasks
    ↓ Generate task checklist
Phase 3: Implementation
    ↓ Use lesson-writer subagent (iterative, lesson-by-lesson)
Phase 4: Validation
    ↓ Use technical-reviewer subagent
Phase 5: Publication
    ↓ Human final review, commit, PR, merge
```

**Key Principle**: Evals → Spec → Plan → Implement → Validate

## 🤝 Onboarding a Domain Expert

**Scenario**: You need an expert for Part 7 (Advanced Python)

### Quick Onboarding Process

1. **Share Documentation** (5 min)
   - Send: CoWriter Guide, Constitution, Part 7 overview

2. **Discovery Session** (1-2 hours)
   - Define business goals and success evals
   - Identify prerequisite knowledge
   - Determine content scope (must/optional/out-of-scope)

3. **First Chapter Walkthrough** (~4 hours)
   - Pick one representative chapter
   - Walk through full SDD loop together
   - Expert sees how AI handles formatting/metadata

4. **Establish Collaboration Patterns**
   - Agree on review process
   - Define approval authority
   - Set communication cadence

5. **Scale Up Production** (Week 2+)
   - Expert works on specs in parallel
   - You orchestrate implementation
   - AI handles generation and validation
   - Velocity: 3-4 chapters/week

**See**: CoWriter Guide section "Onboarding Domain Experts" for detailed walkthrough

## ✅ Quality Assurance

### Using technical-reviewer

**When to validate**:
- After each lesson (spot-check during development)
- After complete chapter (comprehensive before PR)
- After addressing feedback (re-validation)

**What it checks**:
- Constitution v3.0.1 alignment (evals-first, spec-first)
- Output-styles compliance (structure, YAML metadata)
- Chapter-index accuracy (chapter number, title, prerequisites)
- Code quality (Python 3.13+, type hints, tested)
- Pedagogical effectiveness (learning objectives met, CEFR levels appropriate)

**How to invoke**:
```bash
# Via your AI assistant
"Use technical-reviewer to validate chapter-X for publication readiness"

# It will generate a validation report with:
# - APPROVE / REVISE / RETURN recommendation
# - Critical/Major/Minor issues with file:line references
# - Actionable fix instructions
```

## 📊 Success Metrics (What "Good" Looks Like)

### From Quick Validation Check

**Chapter 31 & 32 Results**:
- ✅ 95% subagent compliance with constitution v3.0.1
- ✅ Output-styles validation: 100%
- ✅ Chapter-index validation: 100%
- ✅ YAML frontmatter validation: 100%
- ⚠️ Minor issues found (closure policy violations, metadata fields)

**Expected for New Chapters**:
- 100% output-styles compliance (subagents now updated)
- 100% metadata (7 fields in YAML frontmatter)
- 0 manual corrections needed (subagents generate correct structure)
- Passes technical-reviewer on first validation

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Which chapters should I prioritize?"

**Answer**: Start with chapters you're most familiar with (subject matter expertise)

**Suggested Priority**:
1. Chapters 1-4 (foundation, high visibility)
2. Your domain expertise chapters (easiest for you)
3. Chapters with critical issues (from audit)

### Issue 2: "Old chapters have many issues. Redesign or repair?"

**Decision Matrix**:

**Redesign** (recommended) if:
- Multiple critical issues (>3)
- Content doesn't match current pedagogy
- Faster to regenerate with updated subagents

**Repair** (faster) if:
- Content is good, just structural issues
- Only 1-2 critical issues
- Minor fixes (YAML metadata, closure policy)

**See**: Essential Tasks Guide for detailed decision criteria

### Issue 3: "technical-reviewer failed validation. What now?"

**Process**:
1. Read validation report carefully (file:line references)
2. Categorize: Critical (must fix) vs Major (should fix) vs Minor (nice to fix)
3. Fix critical issues first
4. Re-validate after fixes
5. Iterate until APPROVE status

**See**: CoWriter Guide section "Addressing Validation Feedback"

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Evals-First Always ✨

**Before writing any spec**, define success criteria:
- What can students DO after this chapter?
- How will we measure success? (quiz, project, rubric)
- What business goals? (employability, skill acquisition)

### 2. Iterate Lesson-by-Lesson

**Don't generate all lessons at once**:
- Generate Lesson 1 → Review → Approve → Commit
- Generate Lesson 2 → Review → Approve → Commit
- Easier to catch issues early
- Builds shared understanding with AI

### 3. Reference, Don't Hardcode

**Do**: "See chapter-index.md for current chapter list"
**Don't**: "Chapter 12 is at 12-lists-tuples/" (might be wrong)

### 4. Trust but Verify

**Review subagent outputs** before committing:
- Check YAML frontmatter (7 fields present?)
- Check structure (matches output-styles?)
- Check "Try With AI" section (at end of lesson?)

### 5. Validate Early and Often

**After Lesson 1**: Spot-check with technical-reviewer
**After All Lessons**: Comprehensive validation
**After Fixes**: Re-validation
