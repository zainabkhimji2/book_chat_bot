    "long_description": """The era of local-only AI development is over. The future isn't about building agents on your laptop; it's about deploying autonomous systems to production. Cloud Native AI represents the infrastructure foundation, the essential shift from "developer" to "cloud architect." It's a methodology that moves you from "running code locally" to "deploying systems that scale"—where you'll master containerization, orchestration, and cloud-agnostic patterns that power production AI applications.

This course introduces Specification-Driven Infrastructure, the professional approach where you write infrastructure specifications and AI generates Docker, Kubernetes, and DAPR configurations. You'll learn the three pillars of cloud-native AI: Docker for packaging applications into portable containers, Kubernetes for orchestrating containers at scale, and DAPR for cloud-agnostic abstractions that work everywhere. Using AI-Driven Development throughout, you'll master container patterns for AI applications including multi-stage builds for Python dependencies, layer optimization for faster deployments, and agent-friendly networking.

You'll start with Docker Fundamentals, learning to containerize AI applications with Dockerfiles generated from specifications. Then Kubernetes Basics, deploying agent systems with pods, deployments, and services while AI handles YAML complexity. You'll master DAPR Core abstractions—state stores that work with any database, pub/sub that works with any message broker, and service invocation that works across any platform. Finally, Production Kubernetes teaches you observability with OpenTelemetry, horizontal pod autoscaling for traffic spikes, and CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

This isn't just learning tools; it's learning professional infrastructure thinking. By the end, you won't just run agents locally—you'll deploy production systems that scale, monitor themselves, and adapt to demand. You'll understand how to package Python agents into containers, orchestrate them on Kubernetes, and abstract cloud services with DAPR so your code runs anywhere. This is the foundation for everything that follows: distributed agents, stateful systems, and autonomous architectures.""",
