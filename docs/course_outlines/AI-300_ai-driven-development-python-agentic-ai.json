  "long_description": "The era of writing software line-by-line is over. The future isn't about being a faster coder; it's about being a better architect. This course introduces AI-Native Thinking, the fundamental paradigm shift for this new era. It's a methodology that moves you from \"coder\" to \"orchestrator\"—where you'll learn to think in specifications, not just syntax, and collaborate with intelligent systems, not just a compiler. This is how software will be built for the next decade. This course is the practical, hands-on roadmap for that future. You'll start with the Foundations of this new revolution, then get hands-on mastery with your new AI partner, the Google Gemini CLI. You'll learn to communicate like an engineer with Prompt and Context Engineering to get high-quality results. You'll use this new workflow to build production-grade systems with Python and, finally, learn to architect truly autonomous Agentic AI with the Agents SDK. This isn't a new set of tools; it's a new way to build.",
  "learning_modules": "[{\"module_id\":1,\"module_name\":\"Foundations: The AI-Driven Development Revolution\",\"module_description\":\"Understand the fundamental shift happening in software development. Learn why AI-native thinking matters, how specifications guide AI agents, and the economic opportunity in building AI-native applications. This module establishes the mental models for the entire course.\"},{\"module_id\":2,\"module_name\":\"Tools Mastery: Google Gemini CLI\",\"module_description\":\"Deep dive into Google Gemini CLI—an open-source AI coding agent that works everywhere. Learn installation, authentication, built-in tools, extensions, and the MCP (Model Context Protocol) ecosystem. Master the tool you'll use throughout this course.\"},{\"module_id\":3,\"module_name\":\"Communication: Prompt and Context Engineering for AIDD\",\"module_description\":\"Master the art of communicating with AI agents effectively. Learn prompt engineering for development (not ChatGPT-style prompting), context engineering for large projects, and how to write specifications that produce quality code.\"},{\"module_id\":4,\"module_name\":\"Python: The AI-Driven Way\",\"module_description\":\"Learn Python the AI-native way—concepts first, then AI-generated code with validation. Cover Python fundamentals through advanced topics including data types, control flow, functions, modules, object-oriented programming, async patterns, and documentation. Every topic teaches thinking in specifications, not just memorizing syntax.\"},{\"module_id\":5,\"module_name\":\"Building Agentic AI: Agents SDK and Multi-Agent Systems\",\"module_description\":\"Build production-quality agentic AI applications using Agents SDK. Learn agent architecture, tool use, memory systems, reasoning patterns, and multi-agent orchestration. Transition from building traditional software to building autonomous intelligent systems.\"}]",
