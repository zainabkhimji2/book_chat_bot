title: "Lesson Title Here"
chapter: 5
lesson: 1
duration_minutes: 10

# HIDDEN SKILLS METADATA

## Key Differences: Part 1 vs Part 2 Skills

### Part 1 (Chapters 1-4): Foundation
- **Proficiency**: A1 (foundation), A2 (basic application)
- **Complexity**: 3-5 concepts per lesson
- **Focus**: Concepts, transformation understanding, paradigm shifts
- **Skill Categories**: 0% Technical, 70% Conceptual, 30% Soft
- **Assessment**: Recognition, explanation, personal reflection

### Part 2 (Chapter 5): Intermediate
- **Proficiency**: A2 (application), B1 (independent problem-solving)
- **Complexity**: 7-10 concepts per lesson
- **Focus**: Tools, procedures, practical application, workflow design
- **Skill Categories**: 43% Technical, 36% Conceptual, 21% Soft
- **Assessment**: Hands-on procedural, design, troubleshooting, security evaluation

**Transition**: Seamless—Part 2 builds directly on Part 1 philosophical foundations while adding technical tool proficiency

## Skills Coherence Across Parts

### Skills Building from Part 1 → Part 2

| Concept | Part 1 (A1-A2) | Part 2 (A2-B1) |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **AI as Developer Amplifier** | Understanding the paradigm | Building tool setup to use it |
| **Learning WITH AI** | Philosophy introduction | Personalizing Claude Code setup |
| **Professional Growth** | Career path reflection | Competitive advantage via skills |
| **Systems Thinking** | Nine pillars framework | Integration of multiple tools |
| **Specialization** | Recognizing patterns | Building domain-specific skills |

**Progression**: Part 1 asks "Why?" → Part 2 answers "How?" → Part 3+ will ask "What now?"

---

## Validation Framework at Scale

### How Chapter 5 Uses Part 1 Framework

**Five Validation Tests Applied**:
1. ✅ **Uniqueness**: 14 unique skills vs Part 1's 28 (zero overlap)
2. ✅ **Naming**: Distinct verbs appropriate to Intermediate tier
3. ✅ **Progression**: A2→B1 advancement matching complexity tier
4. ✅ **Prerequisites**: All Part 1 dependencies verified
5. ✅ **Connectivity**: All skills connected across 5 lessons

**Coherence Validation Workflow**:
1. Extract all Chapter 5 skills from registry
2. For each skill, run 5 tests
3. Document results in validation report
4. Fix any issues before implementation
5. Update Master Skill Registry

**Output**: Chapter 5 Skills Registry document (already created and validated)

---

## Master Skill Registry Update Path

### Current Status
- **Part 1 Master Skill Registry**: `specs/part-1-skills-registry.md` (28 skills, complete)
- **Chapter 5 Skills Registry**: `specs/part-2-chapter-5-skills-registry.md` (14 skills, validated)

### Future Evolution
**Option 1: Separate Registries** (Current approach)
- Keep Part 1 and Part 2 registries separate
- Pro: Clear organization by part
- Con: More files to manage

**Option 2: Consolidated Registry** (After Part 2 complete)
- Merge Part 1 + Part 2 into single "Book Skills Registry"
- Pro: Single source of truth
- Con: Large file (~50+ skills by Part 2 completion)

**Recommendation**: Start with separate registries per part, consolidate if book reaches 10+ chapters.

## Key Insight: Scaling Skills Metadata

**Part 1 Challenge**: How do we know skills are right and connected?
**Solution Created**: 5-test validation framework + Master Skill Registry

**Part 2 Application**: Scale framework to intermediate-level tool proficiency
**Result**: 14 validated skills building coherently on Part 1 foundation

**Universal Pattern**: As book grows to 55 chapters:
- Maintain single Master Skill Registry
- Apply 5 validation tests to every new skill
- Build progression maps by domain
- Prevent fragmentation, regressions, isolation

**Confidence**: We can now add 200+ more skills across Parts 3-13 knowing:
- ✅ No duplicates (Master Skill Registry prevents it)
- ✅ No regressions (5-test framework catches them)
- ✅ Proper prerequisites (dependencies explicit)
- ✅ Coherent progression (tracks map all skills)
- ✅ Within cognitive limits (Intermediate tier guidelines)

---

**Status**: ✅ Part 2, Chapter 5 Skills Framework Ready for Implementation
**Date**: November 1, 2025
**Next Step**: Add YAML metadata to Chapter 5 lesson files
