# Executive Report: Standardized Report Templates System

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: 2025-11-10
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready
**Constitution Version**: v3.1.2

---

## Executive Summary

We have successfully implemented a **standardized report template system** for two critical workflow commands: `/sp.error-analysis` and `/sp.constitution-sync`. This system brings consistency, completeness, and intelligence to our quality assurance and maintenance workflows.

**Key Achievement**: Both commands now follow SpecKit+ conventions with standardized templates, helper scripts, and organized historical outputs—ensuring publication-ready reports, not rough drafts.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Error Analysis System

**Command**: `/sp.error-analysis`
**Purpose**: Diagnose workflow quality issues through AI co-learning lens

**Components**:
- ✅ **Report Template**: `.specify/templates/error-analysis-report-template.md` (375 lines)
- ✅ **Helper Scripts**: 4 bash scripts in `.specify/scripts/bash/error-analysis/`
- ✅ **Output Directory**: `history/error-analysis/`
- ✅ **Command Updated**: References template with clear usage instructions

**Output Example**: `history/error-analysis/2025-11-10-chapter-14-full-analysis.md`

---

### 2. Constitution Sync System

**Command**: `/sp.constitution-sync`
**Purpose**: Apply minimal necessary intervention to bring chapters into constitutional compliance

**Components**:
- ✅ **Report Template**: `.specify/templates/constitution-sync-report-template.md` (482 lines)
- ✅ **Helper Scripts**: 3 bash scripts in `.specify/scripts/bash/constitution-sync/`
- ✅ **Output Directory**: `history/constitution-sync/`
- ✅ **Command Updated**: References template with clear usage instructions

---

## System Architecture

### Design Philosophy

**AI Intelligence at Core**:
- **Scripts provide**: Quantitative data (counts, flags, patterns)
- **AI provides**: Qualitative intelligence (context, severity, recommendations)

**Three-Role Framework Applied**:
- **AI as Teacher**: Diagnoses issues, suggests fixes
- **AI as Student**: Learns context before judging
- **AI as Co-Worker**: Partners on strategic decisions

**Templates as Executable Specifications**:
- Ensure consistent output format
- Guarantee complete coverage
- Produce publication-ready artifacts
- Enable future traceability and analysis

---

## Workflow Integration

### Error Analysis Workflow

```
User runs: /sp.error-analysis 14

↓ Phase 0: Context Immersion (AI learns constitution + chapter)
↓ Phase 1: Quick Triage (5-min assessment with scripts + AI judgment)
↓ Phase 2: Deep Analysis (4 checks: Co-Learning, Pedagogical, Constitutional, Learner Value)
↓ Phase 3: Root Cause Analysis (pattern detection across lessons)
↓ Phase 4: Actionable Recommendations (critical/major/systemic)

Output: history/error-analysis/2025-11-10-chapter-14-full-analysis.md
```

**Modes**:
- `--quick`: Triage only (5 minutes)
- `--lesson N`: Specific lesson analysis
- `--compare-to N`: Compare to previous chapter

---

### Constitution Sync Workflow

```
User runs: /sp.constitution-sync 14

↓ Phase 0: Constitution Delta Analysis (what changed in constitution?)
↓ Phase 1: Spec/Plan Compliance (foundation check)
↓ Phase 2: Per-Lesson Intelligence (surgical/enhanced/full regen/no change)
↓ Phase 3: Chapter-Level Validation (cross-lesson consistency)
↓ Phase 4: Summary Report (narrative + recommendations)

Output: history/constitution-sync/2025-11-10-chapter-14-sync-v3.1.2.md
```

**Intelligent Hybrid**: Each lesson gets exactly what it needs (not one-size-fits-all approach).

## How They Work Together

### Diagnosis + Treatment Pattern

```
Constitution updated (e.g., v3.1.1 → v3.1.2)
         ↓
/sp.constitution-sync 14
         ↓
[Applies fixes to Chapter 14]
         ↓
Issues during sync?
         ↓
/sp.error-analysis 14 (diagnose the sync process itself)
         ↓
[Identifies what went wrong]
         ↓
Fix systemic issues, re-run sync
```

**Key Insight**: Error analysis can debug constitution-sync execution (meta-quality assurance).

---

## Real-World Usage Examples

### Example 1: Quick Health Check

```bash
# Quick triage of Chapter 14 (5 minutes)
/sp.error-analysis 14 --quick

# Output: history/error-analysis/2025-11-10-chapter-14-triage.md
# Result: "PASS - CoLearning elements present, minor formatting issues"
```

### Example 2: Deep Quality Analysis

```bash
# Full analysis of Chapter 14 (30-45 minutes)
/sp.error-analysis 14

# Output: history/error-analysis/2025-11-10-chapter-14-full-analysis.md
# Result:
# - Check 1 (Co-Learning): 85% (DEGRADED - prompts are command-driven)
# - Check 2 (Pedagogical): 95% (PASS)
# - Check 3 (Constitutional): 90% (PASS)
# - Check 4 (Learner Value): 80% (DEGRADED - cognitive overload in Lesson 3)
# Recommendations: Fix 12 prompts to be exploration-focused, simplify Lesson 3
```

### Example 3: Constitution Update Propagation

```bash
# Constitution updated to v3.1.2
# New rule: "No sections after 'Try With AI'"

# Sync Chapter 14 to new constitution
/sp.constitution-sync 14

# Output: history/constitution-sync/2025-11-10-chapter-14-sync-v3.1.2.md
# Result:
# - Lesson 1: Surgical Edit (removed "What's Next" section) - 3 min
# - Lesson 2: No Change (already compliant) - 1 min
# - Lesson 3: Surgical Edit (removed "Key Takeaways" section) - 3 min
# - Lesson 4: Enhanced Regeneration (60% preserved, 40% fixed) - 12 min
# - Lesson 5: No Change (already compliant) - 1 min
# Total: 20 minutes (vs. 2 hours if regenerated all)
```

### Example 4: Comparative Analysis

```bash
# Compare Chapter 14 to Chapter 13 (identify improvements/regressions)
/sp.error-analysis 14 --compare-to 13

# Output: Shows delta between chapters
# Result:
# - CoLearning elements: 14 has +20% more prompts ✅
# - Pedagogical ordering: 14 has 2 forward refs, 13 had 0 ⚠️
# - Learner value: 14 scored 85%, 13 scored 78% ✅
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### Template Placeholders

All templates use `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax for AI to fill:

```markdown
---
id: {{ID}}
title: "Error Analysis: Chapter {{CHAPTER_NUMBER}}"
type: {{TYPE}}  # triage | full-analysis
date: {{DATE_ISO}}
chapter: {{CHAPTER_NUMBER}}
constitution_version: {{CONSTITUTION_VERSION}}
analyst: {{AI_MODEL}}
severity: {{SEVERITY}}  # PASS | DEGRADED | FAIL
---
```

**AI Responsibility**: Replace ALL placeholders with actual data before saving report.

### Script Invocation Pattern

```bash
# Scripts return JSON for AI to parse
.specify/scripts/bash/error-analysis/triage-metrics.sh 14

# Output (JSON):
{
  "colearning_elements": {
    "prompts": 12,
    "commentaries": 8,
    "challenges": 6,
    "tips": 4
  },
  "lesson_closure_violations": 2,
  "forward_references_flagged": 5
}

# AI reads JSON, applies intelligence, judges severity
```

### Report Generation Flow

```
1. AI reads template
2. AI invokes helper scripts (gets quantitative data)
3. AI reads lesson content (gets qualitative context)
4. AI applies intelligence (judges severity, recommends fixes)
5. AI fills template placeholders
6. AI saves report to history/ directory
7. AI displays summary to user
```

---

## Maintenance & Evolution

### Adding New Constitutional Rules

When constitution is updated with new rules:

1. ✅ Update error-analysis command (add to Phase 2 checks)
2. ✅ Update constitution-sync command (add to Phase 2 rule-by-rule checks)
3. ✅ Update helper scripts (if quantitative detection possible)
4. ✅ Test on existing chapter (verify detection and fixing)
5. ✅ Update SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md (document new rule handling)

### Updating Detection Heuristics

When false positives/negatives occur:

1. ✅ Observe patterns (which violations missed or incorrectly flagged?)
2. ✅ Refine scripts (update detection patterns)
3. ✅ Update AI judgment logic (improve context interpretation in command)
4. ✅ Test on problematic chapters (verify improvements)

### Template Versioning

**Version Scheme**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (structure incompatible)
- **MINOR**: New sections/fields (backwards compatible)
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, typo fixes

**Current Version**: `1.0.0` (newly created)
