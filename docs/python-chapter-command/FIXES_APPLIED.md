# Python Chapter Command - FIXES APPLIED (v2.0)

**File Updated**: `.claude/commands/sp.python-chapter.md`

**Status**: ✅ ALL 6 CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED + TECHNICAL REVIEW WORKFLOW INTEGRATED

**Session**: Chapter 13 implementation (Nov 8, 2025) revealed critical improvement: **Technical reviews are essential after plan/tasks and after implementation**

---

## Problems Identified (Reverse-Engineered)

### Problem 1: Chapter Part Mismatch
**Issue**: Chapter labeled in wrong part (Part 4 vs Part 5)
**Root Cause**: Command didn't validate chapter location from authoritative source
**FIX**: Added validation step: "Read chapter-index.md for correct part assignment"

### Problem 2: Forward References to Untaught Concepts
**Issue**: Chapter 13 referenced Spec-Driven Development (Chapter 30+)
**Root Cause**: Command enforced "AI-Native Pedagogy" and "Spec-Driven" methodology not yet taught
**FIX**: Added explicit validation:
```
✅ Validate: Does this mention Chapters 30+? NO
✅ Validate: Does this mention "Spec-Driven Development"? NO
✅ Validate: Does this mention methodology not yet taught? NO
```

### Problem 3: Content Overload
**Issue**: Chapter dumped loops, functions, LangChain, bytecode, OOP, duck typing, async - despite user asking for "beginner"
**Root Cause**: Command assumed "intermediate" complexity even when user said "beginner"
**FIX**: Added explicit user question: "What's the core focus?" (pick ONE)
- CRITICAL instruction: "Do NOT add more concepts, do NOT assume"
- Concept counting: Must be ≤ 5 (beginner), ≤7 (intermediate), ≤10 (advanced)

### Problem 4: Unnecessary File Clutter
**Issue**: Created index.md, _templates/, _assets/, lesson-template.md, capstone-rubric.md, _code-examples/
**Root Cause**: Command had no guidance on minimal scaffolding
**FIX**: Added explicit rules:
```
DO NOT CREATE:
- ❌ index.md
- ❌ _templates/ directory
- ❌ _assets/ directory
- ❌ _code-examples/ directory
- ❌ lesson-template.md
- ❌ capstone-rubric.md

Create ONLY:
- ✅ spec.md
- ✅ plan.md
- ✅ tasks.md
```

### Problem 5: Audience Mismatch
**Issue**: Command decided chapter should be "Intermediate" despite user request for "beginner"
**Root Cause**: Command had logic to "recommend" complexity tier instead of asking user
**FIX**: Rewrote Phase 0 context gathering:
```
Question 1: TARGET AUDIENCE (ask, don't override)
- Absolute beginner (no coding)
- Beginner (some coding)
- Intermediate (comfortable with basics)

CRITICAL: Whatever user answers for Q1 and Q2, that's what you create.
Do NOT override. Do NOT assume.
```

### Problem 6: Wrong Methodology (Self-Referential)
**Issue**: Command enforced "AI-Native Pedagogy" and "Think With Your AI" patterns not yet taught
**Root Cause**: Command referenced its own internal methodology, creating circular dependency
**FIX**: Removed all self-referential methodology references
- Removed: "AI-Native Learning Principle"
- Removed: "3-tier structure" (Concept → Code → Think With AI → Reasoning)
- Removed: References to "preface-agent-native.md" pedagogy (not yet taught)
- Added: Simple teaching structure (What it is → Code Idea → Try It → Why It Matters)

## Command Changes Summary

### Header (Lines 1-15)
**Before**:
```
description: "Create Python chapter spec, plan, tasks with AI-native learning pedagogy"
# Python Chapter: AI-Native Learning Workflow
# "using AI-native pedagogy"
```

**After**:
```
description: "Create Python chapter spec, plan, tasks. Beginner-focused, no forward references, minimal scope"
# Python Chapter Workflow (FIXED)
# ⚠️ THIS COMMAND FIXES CRITICAL ISSUES
# - NO forward references
# - NO self-referential rules
# - NO file clutter
# - Honors user intent
```

### Phase 0: Context Gathering (Lines 161-192)
**Before**:
- Vague questions about "AI colearning, technology choice"
- Didn't ask about "scope" (why user got overloaded)
- Didn't ask about "target audience" (why got intermediate when beginner)

**After**:
```
Question 1: TARGET AUDIENCE (honor their answer)
Question 2: CORE FOCUS (pick ONE, don't add extras)
Question 3: WHAT CAN THEY BUILD? (testable outcome)
Question 4: EXISTING MATERIALS? (yes/no)

CRITICAL: Whatever user answers, that's what you create.
Do NOT override. Do NOT assume.
```

### Phase 1: Spec Generation (Lines 196-256)
**Before**:
- "Lesson Structure (Fixed for all Python chapters)" - forced 5 lessons
- Referenced "evals," "CEFR/Bloom's," "capstone projects"
- Implied "Complete capstone project using AI"

**After**:
```
## NO FORWARD REFERENCES
✅ Validate: Does mention Chapters 30+? NO
✅ Validate: Does mention "Spec-Driven Development"? NO
✅ Validate: Does mention methodology not yet taught? NO

Content Structure:
- Lesson 1: [Topic from core focus]
- Lesson 2: [Topic from core focus]
- Lesson 3: [Topic from core focus - ONLY if in scope]

TOTAL CONCEPTS TAUGHT
[Count them. Verify ≤ tier limit]
```

### Phase 2/3: Plan & Tasks (Lines 260-279)
**Before**:
- No guidance on file structure
- Implied creating complex scaffolding

**After**:
```
Create ONLY:
specs/part-5-chapter-${N}/
  spec.md
  plan.md
  tasks.md

DO NOT CREATE:
- ❌ index.md
- ❌ _templates/
- ❌ _assets/
- ❌ lesson-template.md
- ❌ capstone-rubric.md
```

### Critical Validation (Lines 476-495)
**New section added**:
```
CRITICAL VALIDATION (Before Finalizing Spec)

□ Target audience MATCHES user answer (no override)
□ Core focus MATCHES user answer exactly
□ Scope does NOT add beyond what user asked
□ No chapters 30+ mentioned anywhere
□ No "Spec-Driven Development" mentioned
□ No methodology/pedagogy names mentioned
□ Concept count COUNTED and ≤ tier limit
□ Prerequisites ONLY chapters before this one
□ Learning objectives testable and realistic
□ Students CAN actually build promised project
□ Only 3 files will be created
□ No index.md, templates, assets directories

If ANY check fails → ASK USER, don't assume.
```

### Fixes Summary (Lines 499-508)
**New section added**:
```
FIXES THIS COMMAND IMPLEMENTS

✅ Problem 1: Part mismatch
✅ Problem 2: Forward references
✅ Problem 3: Content overload
✅ Problem 4: File clutter
✅ Problem 5: Audience mismatch
✅ Problem 6: Wrong methodology
```

## How to Test the Fixed Command

```bash
/sp.python-chapter 13

# User should be asked:
1. Target audience? (pick one - command honors choice)
2. Core focus? (pick one - command doesn't add extras)
3. What can they build? (testable outcome)
4. Existing materials? (yes/no)

# System should create:
specs/part-5-chapter-13/
├── spec.md      (ONLY 3-5 concepts, matches user scope)
├── plan.md      (ONLY lessons user scoped, no index.md)
└── tasks.md     (implementation checklist)

# System should NOT create:
❌ _templates/
❌ _assets/
❌ _code-examples/
❌ lesson-template.md
❌ capstone-rubric.md

# Spec should contain:
✅ No "Chapter 30+"
✅ No "Spec-Driven Development"
✅ No "AI-Native Pedagogy" references
✅ Concept count ≤ tier limit
✅ Target audience matches user answer
✅ Scope matches user answer
```

---

## Key Design Principle (New)

**USER INTENT IS AUTHORITY**

- User says "beginner" → Make it beginner (A1-A2, not A2-B1)
- User says "just variables" → Only variables (not + functions + loops)
- User says "5 concepts max" → Exactly 5 max (not "5 + bonus")

**DO NOT OVERRIDE. DO NOT ASSUME. ASK AND HONOR.**

---

## Files Changed

✅ `.claude/commands/sp.python-chapter.md` (507 lines)
- Completely rewritten Phase 0 (context gathering)
- Rewritten Phase 1 (spec generation)
- Added Phase 2/3 guidelines (minimal files)
- Added critical validation section
- Added fixes summary

## Files NOT Changed (Correctly)

These files don't exist and shouldn't be created:
- ❌ `.specify/templates/book/PYTHON_CHAPTER_DESIGN_TEMPLATE.md` (old attempt - delete if exists)
- ❌ `.claude/PYTHON_CHAPTER_WORKFLOW.md` (old attempt - delete if exists)
- ❌ `.claude/templates/` directory (not needed)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fixed command**: `/sp.python-chapter 13`
2. **Verify**: Spec respects user answers, has no forward references, creates only 3 files
3. **Delete old files** if they exist (template, workflow guide)
4. **Use for all Python chapters** (12-29) with confidence

## NEW (v2.0): Technical Review Workflow Integration

**Based on Chapter 13 Implementation Session (Nov 8, 2025)**

### Critical Learning: Reviews are Essential

During Chapter 13 implementation, we discovered:
1. **Technical review after plan/tasks** catches inconsistencies early
2. **Technical review after lesson-writer** prevents publication of flawed content
3. **Early detection prevents rework** of multiple lessons
4. **Metadata validation** catches contradictions (e.g., gatekeeping comments)

### Workflow Update: MANDATORY TECHNICAL REVIEWS

The command now includes explicit review gates:

#### After Phase 2 (Plan & Tasks Creation)
```markdown
CRITICAL: Run technical review after plan/tasks complete

Run this command:
/sp.plan ch-13
→ review plan.md for:
  ✓ Lesson structure is sound
  ✓ Proficiency progression (A1→A2→B1) is correct
  ✓ Cognitive load ≤ limits (2 concepts/lesson)
  ✓ Skills metadata present and accurate

/sp.tasks ch-13
→ review tasks.md for:
  ✓ Acceptance criteria are testable
  ✓ Dependencies are sequenced
  ✓ No forward references
```

#### After Phase 3 (Implementation - Lessons Written)
```markdown
CRITICAL: Run technical-reviewer subagent BEFORE publication

Command to run:
/invoke technical-reviewer chapter-13

Validation checks:
✓ All code examples use Python 3.14.0
✓ Type hints present in ALL code (not optional)
✓ "Try With AI" format: exactly 4 prompts with Expected outcome
✓ No dual-path gatekeeping comments
✓ Metadata matches lessons (no contradictions)
✓ Technical accuracy verified
✓ Constitutional alignment confirmed
✓ Publication ready verdict
```

### Real Example: Chapter 13 Technical Review Finding

**Found**: Metadata comment contradicted chapter goals
```
Line 8 in 04-thinking-like-ai-developer.md:
# NOTE: This lesson is for the PROFESSIONAL PATH ONLY
```

**But**: Chapter README (line 24) stated:
```
"All four lessons are valuable... whether you're a complete
beginner or an experienced developer"
```

**Result**: Gatekeeping contradiction → Immediate fix applied → Content unified

**Lesson**: Technical reviews catch these contradictions before publication. Without review, inconsistent chapter would have shipped.

### Why This Matters

Without technical reviews:
- ❌ Contradictory messaging ships to users
- ❌ Code example errors discovered by students
- ❌ Metadata inconsistencies cause institutional system failures
- ❌ Multiple lessons fail simultaneously

With technical reviews:
- ✅ Inconsistencies caught before multi-lesson implementation
- ✅ Early fixes prevent cascading failures
- ✅ Metadata validated automatically
- ✅ Constitutional alignment verified
- ✅ Publication-ready verdict confirmed

### Command Implementation (Lines TBD)

Updated `/sp.python-chapter.md` now includes:

```markdown
### MANDATORY REVIEW GATES

After /sp.plan:
  → Automatically suggest: "Review plan.md for proficiency progression"

After /sp.tasks:
  → Automatically suggest: "Review tasks.md for acceptance criteria"

After lesson-writer completion:
  → Automatically invoke: `/invoke technical-reviewer chapter-${N}`
  → Require PASS verdict before publication

If technical review finds CRITICAL issues:
  → Return to Phase 1 (refine spec)
  → Return to Phase 3 (refine content)
  → Do NOT proceed to publication

If technical review finds MAJOR issues:
  → Show issues to user
  → User decides: fix or accept
  → Document decision
```
