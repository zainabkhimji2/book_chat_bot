# `/sp.python-chapter` — Sample Input Template

This document shows example inputs you can provide when invoking the Python chapter design command.

You can provide context **inline in your prompt** OR **interactively via Q&A**. Both work equally well.

---

## CRITICAL: Technical Review Workflow (v2.0)

**NEW** — This version includes mandatory technical reviews:

1. **After `/sp.plan` + `/sp.tasks`**: Review plan.md/tasks.md for structure and pedagogy
2. **After lesson-writer completion**: Run technical-reviewer subagent for validation
3. **PASS verdict required**: Before publishing to production

**Command automatically suggests**:
```
After plan complete:
→ Review plan.md for proficiency progression (A1→A2→B1 CEFR levels)

After tasks complete:
→ Review tasks.md for acceptance criteria and dependencies

After all lessons written:
→ /invoke technical-reviewer chapter-${N}
→ Validation checks:
  ✓ Python 3.14.0 (not 3.13)
  ✓ Type hints in ALL code
  ✓ "Try With AI": 4 prompts + Expected outcome
  ✓ No gatekeeping/dual-path comments
  ✓ Metadata consistency
→ PASS = publication ready
→ FAIL = fix and re-review
```

---

## Two Input Styles

### Style A: Inline Context (All Context in Prompt)
Provide your context directly in the prompt. Command reads it and processes immediately, then initiates automatic review gates.

### Style B: Interactive Q&A (Context via Responses)
Command asks 4 questions. You respond with your context. Same result, different interaction style. Review gates triggered automatically after each phase.

---

## Quick Start: Two Input Styles

### Style A: Inline Context (Recommended)

**You type:**
```
/sp.python-chapter ch-13-intro-python

Write Chapter 13: Introduction to Modern Python in Part 4

Core Context & Guiding Philosophy:

This chapter must reflect modern AIDD principles:
- AI-Driven Learning: Students use Claude Code or Gemini CLI as coding partners
- Focus on reasoning and problem-solving, NOT syntax memorization
- AIDD-First: Clarify what you want BEFORE writing code
- Validation-First: Test understanding, not just memorize

Existing Teaching Materials - This is old reference review and get the best ignore irrelevat aspects:
@context/13_chap12_to_29_specs/Lesson_01_Introduction_to_Python.md
@context/13_chap12_to_29_specs/readme.md

Additional Guidance:
- Target: Absolute beginners (no coding experience)
- Scope: Introduction fundamentals only (not Chapter 14's Data Types)
- Length: 3-4 lessons maximum
- Emphasis: Your first Python program + AIDD thinking
```

**Command processes:**
1. Extracts chapter 13
2. Reads chapter-index.md → "Introduction to Python"
3. Parses your guiding philosophy
4. Identifies materials: Lesson_01_Introduction_to_Python
5. Understands guidance: beginners, fundamentals, 3-4 lessons
6. Asks 4 questions **informed by your context**
7. Generates spec/plan/tasks respecting your philosophy

---

### Style B: Interactive Q&A

**You type:**
```bash
/sp.python-chapter 13
```

**Command responds:**
```
Reading specs/book/chapter-index.md...
Found: Chapter 13 - "Introduction to Python"

Checking context/13_chap12_to_29_specs/...
Found: Lesson_01_Introduction_to_Python materials

Q1: Who are we teaching?
```

**You respond:**
```
Absolute beginner — no coding experience
```

**Command continues:**
```
Q2: What's the ONE core focus for THIS chapter?
```

**You respond (with guiding philosophy):**
```
Introduction to modern Python with AIDD thinking:
- Use Claude Code or Gemini CLI as partners
- Focus on reasoning, not syntax memorization
- Apply specification-first thinking
- Practice validation-first learning
```

## Key Guidelines When Providing Input

### ✅ DO:
- **Be specific** about target audience (absolute beginner, beginner, intermediate)
- **Pick ONE focus** (don't add extras)
- **Describe real outcomes** (what they'll actually build)
- **Reference context** (if you want to use existing materials)
- **Honor chapter boundaries** (don't pull Ch 14 content into Ch 13)

### ❌ DON'T:
- **Override chapter title** (it's from chapter-index.md)
- **Add unrelated concepts** (stick to the chapter's focus)
- **Require future chapters** (outcome must use THIS chapter only)
- **Cross boundaries** (don't mix Ch 13 + Ch 14 content)
- **Assume complexity** (let the command ask, then you answer)

---

## Example: What NOT To Do

### ❌ Bad Input (Too Broad)
```
Q2 Response: "Introduction to Python, plus data types, plus functions, plus OOP"
→ Command rejects: "Too many concepts. Pick ONE focus."
```

### ❌ Bad Input (Forward Reference)
```
Q3 Response: "Students will build a Django web app"
→ Command rejects: "Requires knowledge from Ch 30+ (frameworks). Build using Ch 13 concepts only."
```

### ❌ Bad Input (Vague Outcome)
```
Q3 Response: "Students understand Python"
→ Command rejects: "Not testable. What BUILDS do they make?"
```

---

## Real Workflow Example

### You Type:
```
/sp.python-chapter 13
```

### Command Responds:
```
Reading specs/book/chapter-index.md, Part 5...
Found: Chapter 13 - "Introduction to Python"

Checking context/13_chap12_to_29_specs/...
Found: Lesson_01_Introduction_to_Python.md

Now I have 4 questions to design this chapter:

Q1: Who are we teaching? (pick ONE)
  - Absolute beginner (no coding)
  - Beginner (some coding)
  - Intermediate (comfortable with basics)
```

### You Respond:
```
Absolute beginner — no coding experience, might be nervous.
```

### Command Continues:
```
Q2: What's the ONE core focus for THIS chapter?
  (Remember: Don't pull in Ch 14 "Data Types" or Ch 20 "Functions")
```

### You Respond:
```
Just introduction: Python syntax, how to write code, first program.
```

### Command Continues:
```
Q3: What can students BUILD after THIS chapter?
  (Must be doable with Ch 13 concepts alone)
```

### You Respond:
```
A script that asks for their name and prints a greeting.
```

### Command Continues:
```
Q4: From context (Lesson_01_Introduction_to_Python), what fits?
```

### You Respond:
```
Yes, use it. Keep lesson structure, use examples, adapt for absolute beginners.
```

### Command Generates:
```
✅ Creating specs/part-5-chapter-13/spec.md
✅ Creating specs/part-5-chapter-13/plan.md
✅ Creating specs/part-5-chapter-13/tasks.md

CRITICAL VALIDATION:
✓ All concepts in Chapter 13 (not Ch 14+)

## Questions?

- **"Can I include concepts from Chapter 14?"**
  No — respect chapter boundaries. Chapter 13 teaches Introduction only.

- **"Can I skip context materials and start fresh?"**
  Yes — Q4 option: "Start fresh" is always available.

- **"Can I make the chapter more advanced?"**
  Yes — adjust Q1: Pick "Intermediate" instead of "Absolute beginner"

- **"What if the outcome is too complex?"**
  Simplify Q3: Make it testable using ONLY this chapter's concepts.
