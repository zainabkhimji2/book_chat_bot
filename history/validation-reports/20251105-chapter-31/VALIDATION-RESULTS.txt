EXECUTIVE RESULT
================================================================================

STATUS: ✅ APPROVE WITH MINOR REVISIONS

VERDICT: Ready for publication pending 3 minor corrections (estimated 30 minutes)

KEY FINDING: GitHub issue is FULLY RESOLVED

================================================================================
GITHUB ISSUE RESOLUTION VERIFICATION
================================================================================

ORIGINAL CONCERN 1: "AI helps specs but not clearly mentioned"
CURRENT STATUS: ✅ RESOLVED
EVIDENCE:
  - Line 32: "collaboratively write specifications. This isn't cheating—professional"
  - Lines 68-96: Dedicated "Your AI Companion" section
  - Lines 74-82: 5 tools explicitly listed
  - Lines 84-96: 4 specific reasons why AI helps specs

ORIGINAL CONCERN 2: "Iteration cycle not mentioned"
CURRENT STATUS: ✅ RESOLVED
EVIDENCE:
  - Lines 120-147: Explicit 8-step iteration cycle diagram
  - Lines 138-146: Concrete example with AI dialogue
  - Lines 315-372: Three scenarios showing different iteration outcomes
  - Line 147: "NORMAL and EXPECTED... professional practice"

CONCLUSION: Both original concerns are fully addressed. No ambiguity remains.
