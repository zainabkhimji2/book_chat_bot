## Skills & Sub-Agents: Final Architecture

### Skills Being Pre-Created (4 Total)

These are **shared guidance frameworks** used by both humans and AI agents to ensure consistency.

1. **planning.md** — How to analyze source material and create chapter specs
   - Used by: Planner sub-agent (+ humans iterating)
   - Guides: Systematic specification creation from research/content

2. **technical-writing.md** — Voice, tone, readability standards
   - Used by: Chapter-Writer, Lesson-Writer (+ humans iterating)
   - Guides: Consistent voice and style across all 26 chapters

3. **pedagogy.md** — Teaching methodologies and patterns
   - Used by: Chapter-Writer, Lesson-Writer (+ humans iterating)
   - Guides: Show-then-explain, progressive complexity, mistake-driven learning

4. **ai-collaboration.md** — Responsible AI usage and verification
   - Used by: Lesson-Writer, in AI Exercise sections
   - Guides: When/how to use AI, verification patterns, ethical use

**Key Point:** Skills are **shared guidance frameworks** that inform both humans and AI.

### Output Styles Being Pre-Created (4 Total)

These define exact formatting for different content types—used consistently across all chapters.

1. **docusaurus-chapter.md** — Overall chapter structure and frontmatter format
2. **lesson.md** — Individual lesson section formatting (show-then-explain structure)
3. **code-example.md** — Python code formatting (type hints, docstrings, testing)
4. **exercise.md** — AI Exercise formatting (scenario, prompt, reflection questions)

---

### Sub-Agents Being Pre-Created (5 Total)

These are **executable collaborative agents** that work WITH humans (not FOR humans) within the SDD loop.

1. **planner.md** — Creates detailed chapter specifications
   - Input: Source material + pre-setup.md outline
   - Process: Analyzes material → extracts learning objectives → maps dependencies → creates detailed spec
   - Output: specs/part-X/chapter-Y-spec.md
   - Handoff: Humans iterate on spec until ready → chapter-writer

2. **chapter-writer.md** — Creates chapter outline and learning structure
   - Input: Detailed chapter spec + skills
   - Process: Reads spec → creates outline → structures learning objectives → plans sections
   - Output: Chapter outline with structure
   - Handoff: Humans iterate on outline → lesson-writer

3. **lesson-writer.md** — Implements actual lesson content
   - Input: Chapter outline + lesson.md output style + skills
   - Process: Writes lesson sections (show-then-explain) → creates code examples → designs AI exercise
   - Output: Complete chapter content (markdown with all sections)
   - Handoff: Passes to code-validator

4. **code-validator.md** — Tests all Python code
   - Input: Chapter content from lesson-writer
   - Process: Extracts code → runs tests → checks mypy/black → validates style
   - Output: Validation report + fixed code
   - Handoff: If all pass → technical-reviewer; if fail → back to lesson-writer

5. **technical-reviewer.md** — Verifies technical accuracy
   - Input: Code-validated chapter
   - Process: Fact-checks claims → reviews best practices → verifies explanations → checks tool versions
   - Output: Technical review report
   - Handoff: If approved → human; if revisions needed → back to lesson-writer

**Key Point:** Sub-agents are **collaborative orchestrators** in an iterative SDD loop, not one-way generators.

- ✅ "Let's explore this together"
- ✅ "You might wonder why..."
- ✅ "Don't worry if this seems tricky"
- ✅ Use "we" and "you"
- ✅ Active voice
- ✅ Conversational

### DON'T (Academic Authority)
- ❌ "Obviously" / "simply" / "just"
- ❌ "You should already know"
- ❌ Passive voice
- ❌ Condescending language

## Readability Standards

**Targets:**
- Flesch Reading Ease: 60-70
- Grade level: 8th-9th
- Sentence length: 15-20 words average

### 6. Pedagogy Skill ⏳

**File:** `.claude/skills/pedagogy.md`

**Purpose:** Teaching methodologies

**Core Contents:**

```markdown
# Skill: Progressive Pedagogy

## Core Pattern: Show-Then-Explain

### The Pattern
1. Show working code FIRST
2. Explain WHAT it does (high-level)
3. Explain HOW it works (line-by-line)
4. Explain WHY designed this way (principles)
5. Show variations

### Example
```python
# 1. SHOW: Working code first
result = [x * 2 for x in range(5)]
print(result)  # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

# 2. WHAT: Creates doubled numbers
# 3. HOW: Iterates 0-4, multiplies each by 2, builds list
# 4. WHY: More readable than for loop
# 5. VARIATION: Can filter while transforming
result = [x * 2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
```

## Progressive Complexity

**Chapters 1-5:** ONE concept per section, heavy scaffolding
**Chapters 6-15:** TWO concepts per chapter, moderate scaffolding  
**Chapters 16-26:** MULTIPLE concepts, minimal scaffolding

## Mistake-Driven Learning

Always include Common Mistakes section showing:
1. The mistake (actual code)
2. Why it happens (mental model)
3. The fix (correct code)
4. What was learned

### 7. Python Teaching Skill ⏳

**File:** `.claude/skills/python-teaching.md`

**Purpose:** Python-specific instruction

**Core Contents:**

```markdown
# Skill: Python Teaching Methodology

## Progressive Feature Introduction

### Chapters 1-5: Foundations
- Variables, types (str, int, float, bool)
- Control flow (if/while/for)
- Lists and basic operations
- Simple functions

### Chapters 6-10: Building Blocks
- Functions with basic type hints
- Dictionaries and sets
- File operations
- try/except basics
- List comprehensions

### Chapters 15-18: Prompt Engineering
- Complex type hints
- Optional, Union types
- Generic types

### Chapters 19-26: Modern Python 3.13+
- Advanced type hints (Protocols, TypedDict)
- Pattern matching (match/case)
- Dataclasses
- Full mypy workflow

## Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: Indentation is optional
**Truth:** Python uses indentation for structure
**How to teach:**
```python
# Show error with wrong indentation
# Explain Python's philosophy
# Contrast with brace-based languages
```

### Misconception 2: Lists and strings are identical
**Truth:** Strings immutable, lists mutable
**How to teach:**
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[0] = 99  # Works!

my_str = "hello"
my_str[0] = 'H'  # TypeError!
```

## Final Clarity: Sprint Architecture

### ✅ WILL BE PRE-CREATED (15 files):

**Foundation (2 files)**
- ✅ constitution.md (COMPLETE)
- ⏳ specs/pre-setup.md

**Output Styles (4 files)**
- ⏳ .claude/output-styles/docusaurus-chapter.md
- ⏳ .claude/output-styles/lesson.md
- ⏳ .claude/output-styles/code-example.md
- ⏳ .claude/output-styles/exercise.md

**Skills (4 files — shared guidance frameworks)**
- ⏳ .claude/skills/planning.md
- ⏳ .claude/skills/technical-writing.md
- ⏳ .claude/skills/pedagogy.md
- ⏳ .claude/skills/ai-collaboration.md

**Sub-Agents (5 files — collaborative orchestrators)**
- ⏳ .claude/sub-agents/planner.md
- ⏳ .claude/sub-agents/chapter-writer.md
- ⏳ .claude/sub-agents/lesson-writer.md
- ⏳ .claude/sub-agents/code-validator.md
- ⏳ .claude/sub-agents/technical-reviewer.md

**TOTAL: 15 files**

### ❌ NOT IN SCOPE (For Later):

- Additional sub-agents beyond these 5
- Additional skills beyond these 4
- Chapter-specific customizations
- Integration with external APIs or tools
- Advanced features (version control, collaboration, etc.)

### 🎯 Design Principles for This Sprint:

**These 4 skills + 5 sub-agents are sufficient to:**
- Implement the full Spec-Driven Development loop
- Generate a complete, high-quality 26-chapter book
- Maintain consistency through shared infrastructure
- Enable human-AI collaborative writing (not delegation)
- Validate code quality and technical accuracy
- Create a repeatable, scalable process

**Design ensures:**
- AI and humans use the same skills and output styles
- Every stage has iteration points (humans stay immersed)
- Clear handoff criteria between agents
- No one-way delegation (collaborative loop)
- Separation of concerns (plan → structure → write → validate → review)
