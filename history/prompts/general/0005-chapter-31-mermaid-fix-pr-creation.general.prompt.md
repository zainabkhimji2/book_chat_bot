## Prompt

Create a new PR as last was merged

## Response snapshot

**Context**: PR #74 was merged but only included the first two commits (Python version check, project structure correction). The third commit (d3f22a3 - Mermaid diagram replacement) was not included because it was created after PR #74 was opened.

**Action Taken**:
1. Checked main branch status - confirmed PR #74 merged (commits 05e927e and dfd291a present)
2. Confirmed Mermaid replacement commit (d3f22a3) NOT on main - still needed
3. Created new branch `claude/fix-chapter-31-mermaid-011CUrpEQNee69dLkvxLYeY8` from updated main
4. Cherry-picked commit d3f22a3 (Mermaid → ASCII replacement)
5. Pushed new branch to remote
6. Provided PR URL and description for manual PR creation

**New Branch**: `claude/fix-chapter-31-mermaid-011CUrpEQNee69dLkvxLYeY8`
**Commit**: a5dfe38 (cherry-picked from d3f22a3)
**PR URL**: https://github.com/panaversity/ai-native-software-development/pull/new/claude/fix-chapter-31-mermaid-011CUrpEQNee69dLkvxLYeY8

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: New PR ready for Chapter 31 Mermaid diagram fix; completes publication readiness
- 🧪 Tests: Verified commit exists, cherry-pick succeeded, push successful
- 📁 Files: 2 lesson files modified (01-installation-and-setup.md, 06-tasks-phase.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: User creates PR manually; await merge; Chapter 31 fully publication-ready
- 🧠 Reflection: Proper workflow - when PR is merged before all commits are ready, create new PR from updated main with remaining commits

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - clean cherry-pick and push workflow
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - new branch created successfully from updated main
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard PR creation workflow after partial merge
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor if Docusaurus renders ASCII diagrams correctly in production build
