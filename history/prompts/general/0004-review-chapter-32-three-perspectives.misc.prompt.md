tests:
  - Manual validation of all 8 lesson files against spec requirements
  - Constitution alignment check (Principles 12-17: Graduated complexity, specification-first workflow)
  - Technical accuracy verification (git commands, shell scripts, hook implementations)
  - Pedagogical assessment (CEFR/Bloom's/DigComp proficiency levels, cognitive load analysis)
  - Architectural review (two-climax structure, narrative arc, skills progression)

## Prompt

Review Chapter 32 as a student and as a technical reviewer and as an architect @book-source/docs/05-Spec-Driven-Development/32-ai-orchestra-agent-teams-manager

## Response snapshot

Conducted comprehensive three-perspective review of Chapter 32: AI Orchestra - Agent Teams Manager.

**Review Structure:**
1. **Student Perspective**: Evaluated learner experience, accessibility, scaffolding, and clarity
2. **Technical Reviewer Perspective**: Verified technical correctness, code quality, constitution alignment
3. **Architect Perspective**: Assessed design decisions, structural integrity, spec-implementation alignment

**Key Findings:**

**Critical Issues (P0 - Must Fix Before Publication):**
- ISSUE 1: Lesson numbering conflict - both Lesson 6 and Lesson 7 claim to be "Lesson 7" in titles/frontmatter
- ISSUE 6: Incorrect git worktree commands (`../feature-001-upload` creates worktrees outside repo)
- ISSUE 7: Hook script bugs (missing jq dependency check, race conditions, platform-specific commands)

**High Priority Issues (P1 - Should Fix):**
- ISSUE 2: Missing explicit prerequisites section in README
- ISSUE 9: SpecKit orchestration paradigm confusion (manual spawning vs. automated orchestration)
- ISSUE 11: Spec-implementation gap (spec promises 5-7 agents, implementation only demonstrates 3)

**Medium Priority Issues (P2 - Nice to Fix):**
- Terminal management underscaffolded
- Lesson 4 cognitive overload (7 concepts at B1 limit)
- Missing worktree cleanup instructions
- No troubleshooting sections for common errors
- Missing transition bridge between Lesson 4 and Lesson 5

**Overall Assessment:**
- **Score**: 7.35/10 (Good, needs revision)
- **Student Experience**: 7.5/10 - Clear progression but numbering confusion and terminal management gaps
- **Technical Correctness**: 6.5/10 - Good concepts but critical bugs in git commands and hook scripts
- **Architectural Design**: 8.0/10 - Strong structure and narrative arc, minor spec-alignment issues

**Strengths:**
- Excellent skills progression (A2 → B1 → B2 with CEFR/Bloom's/DigComp mapping)
- Strong pedagogical design (two-climax structure, practical exercises)
- Good focus on transferable skills (decomposition thinking 60%, tools 40%)
- Comprehensive capstone project with measurement and portfolio guidance
- No "simulation" language - all exercises are practical and authentic

**Verdict**: **REVISE BEFORE PUBLICATION**
Chapter has strong foundation but critical issues (numbering conflicts, technical bugs, paradigm confusion) must be addressed. With targeted fixes (estimated 6-8 hours for P0-P1 issues), chapter will be publication-ready.

**Detailed Review**: Generated comprehensive 13-issue analysis with specific line references, fix recommendations, and priority ratings for all identified problems.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive three-perspective review completed with 13 specific issues identified, prioritized, and documented with actionable fix recommendations
- 🧪 Tests: All 8 lesson files validated against spec requirements, constitution principles, technical accuracy, and pedagogical standards
- 📁 Files: Reviewed 9 files (8 lesson files + spec), generated detailed findings document with line-specific references
- 🔁 Next prompts: Fix P0 issues (lesson numbering, git commands, hook scripts), then address P1 issues (prerequisites, paradigm clarity, spec alignment)
- 🧠 Reflection: Review uncovered systematic issues that span multiple lessons (git worktree pattern used incorrectly throughout). This suggests need for coordinated fixes rather than lesson-by-lesson patches. The spec-implementation gap (3 vs. 5-7 agents) represents architectural decision point: reduce spec ambition or add extension exercises?

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed:
  - Lesson numbering conflicts across multiple files (lack of systematic validation)
  - Git worktree pattern replicated before validation (incorrect command propagated through chapter)
  - Hook scripts lack cross-platform testing (Linux-specific commands)
  - Terminal management assumed without scaffolding

- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - Constitution alignment: PASS (with minor issues in Lesson 4 cognitive load)
  - Technical accuracy: FAIL (git commands incorrect, hook scripts have bugs)
  - Spec-implementation alignment: PARTIAL (3-agent execution vs. 5-7-agent promise)
  - Student experience: PASS (with improvements needed for terminal setup, prerequisites)

- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (single review prompt)

- Next experiment (smallest change to try):
  - Fix lesson numbering as single atomic change to verify impact on student clarity
  - Test corrected git worktree commands in fresh repository to validate fix
  - Add prerequisites section to README and measure impact on student confidence via pilot feedback
