## Prompt

Follow instructions in [sp.tasks.prompt.md](file:///d%3A/Panaversity/book_development/colearn-ai-devway/.github/prompts/sp.tasks.prompt.md).
Create tasks for the chapter 11. This chapter will cover the AI Driven way of understanding uv for building projects. In AI Driven way, stduents do not try to memorize the commands or syntax but understands the concepts and use AI CLI tools to give uv commands.

## Response snapshot

Successfully generated `specs/011-python-uv/tasks.md` with 100 tasks organized by lesson (6 lessons = 6 user stories).

**Task Organization**:
- **Phase 1: Setup** (5 tasks) - Chapter directory structure, placeholder files, images directory
- **Phase 2: Foundational** (7 tasks) - Command verification on all platforms, diagrams, templates
- **Phase 3-8: Lessons 1-6** (70 tasks) - Content creation organized by lesson/user story
  - Lesson 1 (Why UV): 10 tasks (T013-T022) - Motivation and conceptual understanding
  - Lesson 2 (Installation): 11 tasks (T023-T033) - AI-driven installation across platforms
  - Lesson 3 (First Project): 12 tasks (T034-T045) - Project creation and structure
  - Lesson 4 (Dependencies): 14 tasks (T046-T059) - Dependency management workflows
  - Lesson 5 (Running Code): 11 tasks (T060-T070) - Execution and environment isolation
  - Lesson 6 (Collaboration): 12 tasks (T071-T082) - Team workflows and reproducibility
- **Phase 9: Integration** (11 tasks) - Cross-lesson coherence, platform testing, quiz/exercise
- **Phase 10: Validation** (7 tasks) - Technical review and publication preparation

**Key Features**:
- All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- Story labels (L1-L6) map lessons to user stories from spec.md
- Parallel tasks marked with [P] (setup, diagrams, platform testing)
- Sequential lesson dependencies enforced (L1→L2→L3→L4→L5→L6)
- All UV commands must be tested on Windows/Mac/Linux (T006-T007, T086-T088)
- Every lesson includes AI prompt-response examples (4-part pattern: Prompt→Response→Output→Teaching)
- Complexity tier compliance: max 7 concepts per lesson, A2-B1 level
- Skills metadata in YAML frontmatter for each lesson

**Success Criteria Mapped**:
- SC-001: Explain UV's value → T013-T022 (Lesson 1)
- SC-002: Create UV project via AI → T034-T045 (Lesson 3)
- SC-003: Manage dependencies via AI → T046-T059 (Lesson 4)
- SC-004: Run code with isolation → T060-T070 (Lesson 5)
- SC-005: Share project with teammates → T071-T082 (Lesson 6)
- SC-006: Troubleshoot errors → T029, T055, T067 (error scenarios)
- SC-007: 15+ prompt-response examples → T083-T084 (verification)

**Dependencies**:
- Setup → Foundational (must complete command verification before writing)
- Foundational → All Lessons (diagrams and templates ready)
- Lessons written sequentially (prerequisite flow)
- Integration after all lessons complete
- Validation after integration

**MVP Scope Defined**:
- Must Have: Lessons 1-3 (motivation → installation → first project)
- Should Have: Lessons 4-6 (dependencies → execution → collaboration)
- Nice to Have: Advanced features appendix, video walkthrough

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown for Chapter 11 (100 tasks across 10 phases) enabling independent lesson writing and review
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests; validation via technical-reviewer (T094), manual command testing (T086-T088), Docusaurus build (T097)
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/011-python-uv/tasks.md` (detailed task list with dependencies and parallel opportunities)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin Phase 1 (Setup) tasks, or invoke lesson-writer subagent for Lesson 1 implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Task organization by lesson (not by file type) enables independent development and testing of each lesson as a complete unit

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None during task generation; potential issues: (1) lessons may need reordering if prerequisite flow breaks, (2) platform testing (T086-T088) requires access to all 3 OS environments, (3) AI prompt-response examples must be authentic (not fabricated)
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable for task generation; validation occurs during implementation phases
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks command with feature-specific context (AI-driven UV education)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): After Phase 2 completion, test one lesson (L1) end-to-end before scaling to all 6 lessons; validate AI prompt-response pattern effectiveness with real readers
