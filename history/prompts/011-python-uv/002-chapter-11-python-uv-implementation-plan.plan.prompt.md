## Prompt

Follow instructions in sp.plan.prompt.md.
Generate a plan using chapter-planner.md carefully aligned with constitution.md and cowriter-guide. The reader/learner is a beginner with no prior programming and software development experience. Only use AI CLI Tool like Claude Code or Gemini CLI as AI collaborator. Generate complete output when adding the prompt (what user asked), What actions AI cli tool took and the output.

**Phase 3: Content Flow & Scaffolding**

**Lesson Progression Logic**:
```
Lesson 1 (Why UV?) → Motivation established
  ↓
Lesson 2 (Installation) → UV installed and verified
  ↓
Lesson 3 (First Project) → Project structure created
  ↓
Lesson 4 (Dependencies) → Packages installed
  ↓
Lesson 5 (Running Code) → Execution successful
  ↓
Lesson 6 (Collaboration) → Team workflows ready
  ↓
Lesson 7 (Advanced Features) → Complete UV competency
```

**Complexity Scaffolding**:
- Lesson 1: Conceptual only (no commands) - 6 concepts
- Lesson 2: First hands-on - 7 concepts
- Lessons 3-5: Progressive skill building - 7 concepts each
- Lesson 6: Integration of prior skills - 7 concepts
- Lesson 7: Synthesis and exploration - 7 concepts

**AI Assistance Scaffolding**:
- Early (1-3): AI provides complete commands with explanations
- Middle (4-5): AI responds to specific needs (less hand-holding)
- Late (6-7): AI as discovery partner (exploratory questions)

**Phase 4: Validation Strategy Design**

**Formative Assessment** (During lessons):
- Reflection questions (conceptual sections)
- Hands-on verification (AI confirms success)
- Troubleshooting scenarios (error diagnosis with AI)
- "Teach back" checks (explain to AI)

**Summative Assessment** (End of chapter):
1. **Quiz Assessment**: 15 questions, 75%+ passing (conceptual understanding, no memorization)
2. **Hands-On Exercise**: "Create FastAPI Project with UV and AI" (project running, structure understood)
3. **Real-World Application**: "Prepare Project for Team Collaboration" (teammate can recreate environment)
4. **Teaching Ability**: "Teach UV to a Peer" (peer successfully uses UV with student's guidance)
5. **AI Interaction Quality**: Effective collaboration (clear prompts, validation, troubleshooting)

**CEFR-Aligned Rubric**:
- A1 (Fail): Cannot perform skill
- A2 (Pass): Performs with AI guidance
- B1 (Target): Performs independently with AI
- B2 (Exceed): Handles complex scenarios, teaches others

**Constitutional Alignment Verification**:
- ✅ AI-First Teaching (Principle 1): Every lesson uses AI CLI tools, prompt-response pattern throughout
- ✅ Spec-First Methodology (Principle 2): Business Goals → Evals → Requirements structure followed
- ✅ Modern Python Standards (Principle 3): pyproject.toml emphasized, UV as modern standard
- ✅ Validation-First Safety (Principle 4): Safety notes in all "Try With AI" sections
- ✅ Progressive Complexity (Principle 5): Conceptual → hands-on → integration → discovery
- ✅ Domain Skills Integration: 6 skills applied (learning objectives, concept scaffolding, assessment builder, AI-collaborate teaching, technical clarity, exercise designer)

**Output Generated**:

Created `specs/011-python-uv/plan.md` with:
- Complete 7-lesson architecture (79 pages of detailed planning)
- Skills proficiency mapping (CEFR A2-B1 progression)
- Learning objectives (Bloom's taxonomy for each lesson)
- Content outlines (7 concepts max per lesson)
- Prompt-response patterns (minimum 20 examples specified)
- "Try With AI" sections (end-of-lesson AI activities)
- Assessment strategy (5 evaluation methods with rubric)
- Constitutional alignment checklist (all principles verified)
- Implementation notes for lesson writers (tone, visuals, safety)
- Validation checklist (before publishing)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation plan for Chapter 11 (Python UV) ready for lesson-writer agent
- 🧪 Tests: Constitutional alignment verified, skills proficiency validated (A2-B1), complexity tier confirmed (intermediate, max 7 concepts)
- 📁 Files: `specs/011-python-uv/plan.md` (79 pages, comprehensive lesson architecture)
- 🔁 Next prompts: 
  - `/sp.tasks` to generate actionable task checklist from this plan
  - `/sp.implement` with lesson-writer agent to generate content
  - `/sp.validate` with technical-reviewer to verify quality
- 🧠 Reflection: This is the first chapter in Part 4, establishing UV as the standard Python tooling for all subsequent chapters (12-29). The AI-driven teaching pattern is critical: students learn concepts through AI collaboration, not command memorization. Beginner-friendly positioning (A2-B1) appropriate for first Python tooling chapter.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None detected. Plan follows chapter-planner agent instructions, constitution v3.0.1 principles, and COWRITER-GUIDE workflow.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):

  - ✅ PASS: Skills proficiency mapping (CEFR A2-B1 validated, no regressions, cognitive load respected)
  - ✅ PASS: Complexity tier (intermediate scaffolding, max 7 concepts, AI as primary executor)
  - ✅ PASS: Learning objectives (Bloom's taxonomy applied to all 7 lessons)
  - ✅ PASS: Prompt-response pattern (minimum 20 examples across all lessons)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard `/sp.plan` workflow with chapter-planner agent
