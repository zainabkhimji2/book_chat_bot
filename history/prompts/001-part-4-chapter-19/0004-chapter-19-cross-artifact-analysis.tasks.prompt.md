## Prompt

for 001-part-4-chapter-19

## Response snapshot

Performed comprehensive cross-artifact analysis validating spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md for consistency, coverage, and constitutional alignment.

**Analysis Summary:**
- **Status**: ✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION (0 CRITICAL issues)
- **Artifacts Analyzed**: spec.md (473 lines), plan.md (1,775 lines), tasks.md (374 lines), constitution.md (v3.0.2)
- **Coverage**: 100% (42/42 functional requirements mapped to implementation tasks)
- **Constitutional Compliance**: 100% (15/15 applicable principles validated)
- **Issues Found**: 3 LOW severity findings (terminology consistency, metadata specification)

**Detailed Findings:**

**T1 (LOW - Terminology Drift):**
- Issue: Inconsistent labeling between "User Scenarios" (spec) and "Learning Journeys" (tasks)
- Impact: Minimal confusion; context makes mappings clear
- Recommendation: Standardize on "Learning Journey" for future chapters

**M1 (LOW - Metadata Underspecification):**
- Issue: Reading level validation tasks (T020, T037, T053, T066, T081, T093) reference "automated readability check" without specifying tool
- Impact: Implementation ambiguity (which tool?)
- Recommendation: Specify "using Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level calculator"

**C1 (LOW - Skills Metadata Validation):**
- Issue: Skills metadata (CEFR, Bloom's, DigComp) defined in plan but not explicitly mentioned in task validation
- Impact: Minor validation gap
- Recommendation: Amend YAML frontmatter validation tasks to include skills metadata

**Coverage Analysis:**
- ✅ LJ1 (Set Basics): FR-001 to FR-006 → T007-T020 (14 tasks)
- ✅ LJ2 (Set Operations): FR-007 to FR-012 → T021-T037 (17 tasks)
- ✅ LJ3 (Set Internals): FR-013 to FR-018 → T038-T053 (16 tasks)
- ✅ LJ4 (Frozensets): FR-019 to FR-023 → T054-T066 (13 tasks)
- ✅ LJ5 (Garbage Collection): FR-024 to FR-029 → T067-T081 (15 tasks)
- ✅ LJ6 (Capstone): FR-030 to FR-035 → T082-T093 (12 tasks)
- ✅ Constitutional: FR-036 to FR-042 → T094-T101 (8 validation tasks)

**Constitutional Validation:**
- Principle 1 (AI-First Teaching): ✅ "Try With AI" closure enforced
- Principle 6 (Consistent Structure): ✅ Lesson closure standard documented
- Principle 12 (Cognitive Load): ✅ A2 max 7, B1 max 10 concepts validated
- Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching): ✅ Book → AI Companion → AI Orchestration pattern
- All 15 applicable principles: ✅ PASS

**Metrics:**
- Requirements Coverage: 100% (42/42)
- Learning Journey Coverage: 100% (6/6)
- Success Criteria Assessment: 100% (6/6)
- Ambiguity Count: 0
- Duplication Count: 0
- Critical Issues: 0

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Cross-artifact validation confirms Chapter 19 planning artifacts are consistent, complete, and ready for implementation with zero blocking issues
- 🧪 Tests: Coverage validation (PASS 100%), constitutional alignment (PASS 100%), ambiguity detection (PASS 0 found), duplication detection (PASS 0 found), critical issues (PASS 0 found)
- 📁 Files: Analysis report generated (read-only mode, no files modified per command requirements)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed to Phase 4 implementation with lesson-writer subagent for Learning Journey 1 (Lesson 1: Set Basics)
- 🧠 Reflection: 3 LOW severity findings are optional improvements with zero functional impact. Exceptional alignment across spec→plan→tasks demonstrates mature workflow execution. 100% coverage enables MVP-first (LJ1 only) or parallel implementation (6 LJs concurrently).

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Analysis completed successfully with zero critical or high-severity issues blocking implementation.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - Coverage Grader: PASS (100% requirements mapped to tasks)
  - Constitutional Grader: PASS (15/15 principles validated)
  - Ambiguity Grader: PASS (0 vague terms, all metrics specific)
  - Duplication Grader: PASS (0 duplicate requirements)
  - Consistency Grader: PASS (terminology drift is LOW severity, doesn't affect execution)
  - Underspecification Grader: MINOR (2 LOW findings - metadata tool specification)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (first cross-artifact analysis for 6-lesson pattern)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): For future chapters, ensure "Learning Journey" terminology used consistently from spec through tasks to eliminate T1 finding type
