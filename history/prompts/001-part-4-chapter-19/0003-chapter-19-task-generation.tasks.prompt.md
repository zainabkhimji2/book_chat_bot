## Prompt

for 001-part-4-chapter-19

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list with 101 actionable tasks for implementing Chapter 19's 6 lessons.

**Task Organization:**
- **Phase 1: Setup** (3 tasks) - Create chapter directory structure
- **Phase 2: Foundational** (3 tasks) - Chapter-level requirements (BLOCKS all lessons)
- **Phase 3: LJ1** (14 tasks) - Lesson 1: Set Basics (A2, 7 concepts, 50 min)
- **Phase 4: LJ2** (17 tasks) - Lesson 2: Set Operations (A2-B1, 7 concepts, 50 min)
- **Phase 5: LJ3** (16 tasks) - Lesson 3: Set Internals & Hashing (B1, 9 concepts, 50 min)
- **Phase 6: LJ4** (13 tasks) - Lesson 4: Frozensets (A2-B1, 7 concepts, 40 min)
- **Phase 7: LJ5** (15 tasks) - Lesson 5: Garbage Collection (B1, 9 concepts, 50 min)
- **Phase 8: LJ6** (12 tasks) - Lesson 6: Memory Profiler Capstone (B1-B2, 9 concepts, 60 min)
- **Phase 9: Polish** (8 tasks) - Cross-cutting concerns and validation

**Key Task Details:**
- **Total**: 101 tasks from setup to publication
- **Parallel Opportunities**: 25+ tasks marked [P] can run concurrently
- **MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 (Setup + Foundational + LJ1) = Minimal viable lesson (students can start)
- **Full Chapter**: All phases = 6 complete lessons + capstone

**Task Format Compliance:**
Every task follows strict format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [LJ#] Description with file path`
- Checkbox: `- [ ]`
- Sequential ID: T001-T101
- [P] marker: For parallelizable tasks
- [LJ#] label: Maps to learning journey (LJ1-LJ6)
- Description: Clear action with exact file path

**Dependency Graph:**
```
Setup (Phase 1) → Foundational (Phase 2) → Learning Journeys (Phases 3-8)
                                             ├─ LJ1 (P1) ─┐
                                             ├─ LJ2 (P1) ─┤
                                             ├─ LJ3 (P2) ─┤
                                             ├─ LJ4 (P2) ─┼─→ LJ6 (P3) → Polish (Phase 9)
                                             ├─ LJ5 (P2) ─┘
```

**Content Policy for Lesson Authors** (Critical):
- Each lesson MUST end with single "Try With AI" section
- NO "Key Takeaways" sections (Constitution Rule 6 violation)
- NO "What's Next" sections (unless chapter-level in intro.md)
- AI tool selection: Preferred AI companion (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, ChatGPT web) after Part 1

**Validation Gates:**
- After each lesson: technical-reviewer (code quality, pedagogy)
- After all lessons: proof-validator (publication readiness)
- Chapter-level: Constitutional compliance (all 17 principles)
- Reading level: Grade 7-8 (Flesch-Kincaid 7.0-8.0)
- Cognitive load: A2 max 7 concepts, B1 max 10 concepts

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: 101 actionable tasks enable systematic implementation of 6-lesson chapter following ADR-0008 pattern
- 🧪 Tests: Format validation (PASS), independence validation (PASS), dependency graph (PASS), content policy (PASS)
- 📁 Files: tasks.md (101 tasks, 9 phases, 25+ parallel opportunities)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.analyze` to validate cross-artifact consistency, then invoke lesson-writer subagent for implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Task organization by learning journey enables MVP-first delivery (Lesson 1 only) or parallel team implementation (6 writers simultaneously)

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Task generation successful, all format requirements met.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - Format Grader: PASS (all 101 tasks have checkbox, ID, [P], [LJ#], description, file path)
  - Independence Grader: PASS (each LJ produces testable lesson)
  - Dependency Grader: PASS (LJ6 correctly depends on LJ1-LJ5; foundational blocks all LJs)
  - Content Policy Grader: PASS (lesson closure standard documented, AI tool selection clear)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (first implementation of 6-lesson task structure)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate tasks.md against plan.md and spec.md for consistency using /sp.analyze command
