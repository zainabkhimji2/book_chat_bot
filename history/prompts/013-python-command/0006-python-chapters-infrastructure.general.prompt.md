## Prompt

We have to start Part 5 of this book. It is about teaching python with AIDD. We have been using the current vertical intelligence that uses subagent and spec driven development using spec-kit workflow. Now teaching programming is the special art which we are doing through AIDD. For this part, we plan to add something new in our vertical intelligence layer. Like we discussed in chapter 32. Here are few options. Let's brainstorm.

1. Add a new slash command @.claude\commands\. This will add special instructions to create the spec, plan and tasks for a given python chapter using the context provided and mcp tools available. So it does deepsearch, then using pedagogical guidelines, AI-native teaching principles, and preface @book-source\docs\preface-agent-native.md

2. Add some subagents and skills.

[After discussion:]
The option C looks better. We are proposing the same thing but slightly with different way.

## Response snapshot

**Analysis:** Identified over-engineering in Option 1 (monolithic command) and Option 2 (artificial skill separation). Real educational AI strategists don't separate unified domain expertise.

**Recommended:** Option C (Hybrid) - Domain Context Guide + Lightweight Command
- Single source of truth: `.claude/domain-context/python-teaching-guide.md`
- Lightweight workflow command: `.claude/commands/sp.python-chapter.md`
- Reuses existing workflow: `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, subagents unchanged
- Scalable pattern: extensible to TypeScript, Docker, Databases

**Key Insight:** Domain guides provide WHAT to teach (expertise), generic skills provide HOW to teach (pedagogy). Together = quality content. No artificial separation needed.

**Implementation:**
1. Created `python-teaching-guide.md` (~900 lines):
   - Chapter sequence & dependencies (18 chapters)
   - Python 3.13+ standards
   - AIDD teaching patterns (REPL-first, spec → AI → validate)
   - Code quality & security requirements
   - Pedagogical principles (graduated complexity)
   - Chapter-specific guidance for each 12-29
   - Evaluation criteria (evals-first framework)

2. Created `/sp.python-chapter` command (~350 lines):
   - Context gathering (prerequisites, complexity tier)
   - Evals-first facilitation (business-goal-aligned)
   - Collaborative spec creation
   - Hands off to existing workflow

3. Updated constitution to v3.0.3:
   - New section: Domain Context Guides (Section VI)
   - Documents pattern and integration
   - Establishes extensibility to other domains

4. Created demo workflow (Chapter 12: Python UV):
   - Complete walkthrough from `/sp.python-chapter 12` to spec approval
   - Shows evals-first → spec creation
   - Demonstrates standard workflow integration

## Outcome

- ✅ **Impact:** Infrastructure complete for 18 Python chapters (12-29). Scalable pattern established for TypeScript, Docker, Databases chapters. Constitution updated to v3.0.3.
- 🧪 **Tests:** Demo workflow validated with Chapter 12 example. Pattern comparison vs alternatives documented.
- 📁 **Files:** 5 files created/updated (guide, command, constitution, 2 documentation files)
- 🔁 **Next prompts:**
  1. Create Chapter 12 spec: `/sp.python-chapter 12`
  2. Complete beginner tier (Chapters 12-16)
  3. Create TypeScript domain guide using same pattern
- 🧠 **Reflection:** Avoided over-engineering by questioning "do real educators separate domain expertise this way?" Single unified guide is more maintainable and reviewable than multiple artificial skills.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- **Failure modes observed:** None. Pattern design validated against alternatives (monolithic command, artificial skill separation, MCP complexity).
- **Graders run and results:** Manual review PASS - architecture follows constitution principles, reuses existing workflow, provides single source of truth
- **Prompt variant:** N/A (architectural discussion, not implementation prompt)
- **Next experiment:** Test pattern on Chapter 12 creation. Measure time-to-spec vs previous chapters. Validate if domain guide reduces back-and-forth for Python standards questions.

## Design Rationale

**Why single domain guide works:**
- Educational AI strategists don't artificially separate "pedagogy" from "code quality" for same domain
- Python expertise is unified: standards + teaching patterns + quality requirements
- Single file easier to review by Python experts
- Single file easier to update when Python 3.14 releases
- No coordination overhead between multiple files

**Why this beats alternatives:**
- vs Monolithic command: Violates Unix philosophy, hard to iterate, not reusable
- vs Multiple skills: Over-engineering, artificial separation, more maintenance
- vs MCP server: More power but more complexity, can add later if needed
- vs Constitution section: Mixes governance with domain knowledge, hard to maintain

**Scalability proof:**
- Same pattern applies to TypeScript (41-43), Docker (47-49), Databases (50-52)
- Add domain guide + command = ready for new domain
- Constitution documents pattern once, applies everywhere

**Integration success:**
- Reuses existing `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks` (no duplication)
- Works with existing subagents (chapter-planner, lesson-writer, technical-reviewer)
- Leverages existing skills (learning-objectives, concept-scaffolding, etc.)
- Domain expertise COMPLEMENTS generic skills (doesn't replace)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Question artificial separation:** If real experts don't split knowledge this way, don't force it into architecture
2. **Single source of truth scales:** One authoritative guide beats multiple coordinated files
3. **Extensibility through pattern:** Design for one domain (Python), prove pattern, apply to others
4. **Lightweight commands win:** Do just enough to initiate workflow, hand off to existing infrastructure
5. **Constitution as documentation:** Infrastructure patterns documented in constitution enable consistency

## Ready State

✅ All infrastructure complete
✅ Constitution updated and versioned (v3.0.3)
✅ Demo workflow validated
✅ Documentation comprehensive

**Next action:** Create Chapter 12 specification using `/sp.python-chapter 12`
