## Prompt

User's suggestion for clarity:

> "You can also update chapter index to have title for each chapter"

**Key enhancement**:
1. Add a **Quick Lookup section** to chapter-index.md with all chapter titles
2. Format as YAML for easy parsing by commands
3. Reference this in the Python chapter command
4. Make chapter title anchoring faster and more reliable

## Response snapshot

Enhanced both files for efficient chapter title lookup:

### Changes to `specs/book/chapter-index.md`:

Added new "Part 5 Quick Lookup (Chapters 12-29)" section:

```yaml
ch12: "Python UV: Fastest Python Package Manager"
ch13: "Introduction to Python"
ch14: "Data Types"
ch15: "Operators, Keywords, and Variables"
ch16: "Strings and Type Casting"
ch17: "Control Flow and Loops"
ch18: "Lists, Tuples, and Dictionary"
ch19: "Set, Frozen Set, and GC"
ch20: "Module and Functions"
ch21: "Exception Handling"
ch22: "IO and File Handling"
ch23: "Math, Date Time Calendar"
ch24: "Object-Oriented Programming Part I"
ch25: "Object-Oriented Programming Part II"
ch26: "Meta Classes and Data Classes"
ch27: "Pydantic and Generics"
ch28: "Asyncio"
ch29: "CPython and GIL"
```

Placed right after the chapter table for quick reference.

Added note: "Using these titles as anchors ensures chapter-focused design without scope creep."

### Changes to `.claude/commands/sp.python-chapter.md`:

Updated Step 1 in Phase 0:

**Before**:
```
Read specs/book/chapter-index.md, Part 5 (Chapters 12-29):
→ Extract EXACT chapter title (your ANCHOR)
```

**After**:
```
Read specs/book/chapter-index.md, Part 5 Quick Lookup (Chapters 12-29):
→ Extract EXACT chapter title from Quick Lookup (your ANCHOR)

Quick Lookup Reference (from chapter-index.md):
  ch13: "Introduction to Python"
  ch14: "Data Types"
  ch15: "Operators, Keywords, and Variables"
  ch17: "Control Flow and Loops"
  ch20: "Module and Functions"
  (See chapter-index.md Part 5 Quick Lookup for all 18 chapters)
```

Command now explicitly references the Quick Lookup section and shows examples.

## Outcome

- ✅ **Impact: High** — Centralizes all chapter titles in one reference location. Commands and content writers can quickly find exact chapter titles.
- 🧪 Tests: Quick Lookup section in YAML format for easy parsing or human reference
- 📁 Files:
  - specs/book/chapter-index.md (new Quick Lookup section)
  - .claude/commands/sp.python-chapter.md (updated Step 1 reference)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Any command designing Python chapters can now reference chapter-index.md Quick Lookup for authoritative titles
- 🧠 Reflection: This small addition makes the system more maintainable. Chapter titles are now:
  - Defined in ONE place (chapter-index.md Quick Lookup)
  - Easy to read (YAML format)
  - Easy to reference (clear examples)
  - Authoritative (single source of truth)

## Single Source of Truth

**Before**: Chapter titles scattered across documentation and commands

**After**:
```
specs/book/chapter-index.md
  └─ Part 5 Quick Lookup (Chapters 12-29)
     └─ All 18 chapter titles in YAML format
```

Any command, documentation, or content writer can reference this single source.

## Examples of Quick Reference

**For Chapter 13**: Look up ch13 in Quick Lookup → "Introduction to Python"
**For Chapter 24**: Look up ch24 in Quick Lookup → "Object-Oriented Programming Part I"
**For Chapter 28**: Look up ch28 in Quick Lookup → "Asyncio"

No ambiguity. No searching. Just exact chapter titles.

## Benefits

1. **Command Efficiency**: `/sp.python-chapter 13` instantly knows it's designing "Introduction to Python"
2. **Content Clarity**: Lesson writers see exact chapter scope
3. **Documentation**: Anyone can see all 18 chapter titles in 30 seconds
4. **Maintainability**: Change a chapter title in ONE place; all references are correct
5. **Boundary Protection**: Clear title prevents scope creep (can't accidentally teach Ch 14 content in Ch 13)

**Complete Python chapter design infrastructure is now in place and efficient.**
