## Prompt

Generate the plan

## Response snapshot

Invoked chapter-planner subagent to transform the approved specification into a detailed implementation plan with lesson-by-lesson breakdown and actionable task checklist.

**Plan Architecture (9 sections, 2,000-2,500 words)**:

1. **Section 1: The Hook** (250 words) — Opening story with relatable developer scenario showing transformation scale
2. **Section 2: $3T Economy** (450 words) — Economic magnitude analysis with calculation breakdown
3. **Section 3: Software Disrupting Itself** (350 words) — The fundamental irony and implications
4. **Section 4: Development Lifecycle** (350 words) — Systemic transformation across all phases
5. **Section 5: Changing Developer Roles** (350 words) — From typist to orchestrator
6. **Section 6: Autonomous Agent Era** (350 words) — Evolution from assistants to agents
7. **Section 7: Opportunity Window** (350 words) — Why NOW is the best time
8. **Section 8: Education Gap** (300 words) — Traditional CS obsolescence
9. **Section 9: Bridge to Chapter 2** (250 words) — Transition and momentum building

**Task Breakdown (16 tasks, 3 phases)**:

- **Phase 1: Content Structure** (10 tasks) — Write README + 9 sections [40-50 hours]
- **Phase 2: Engagement & Evidence** (4 tasks) — Sources, videos, examples, reflections [8-10 hours]
- **Phase 3: Quality Assurance** (6 tasks) — Accessibility, accuracy, pedagogy, polish [12-15 hours]

**Key Features**:
- Progressive complexity management (cognitive load consideration)
- Audience-specific scaffolding (beginners, professionals, skeptics, educators)
- Evidence-first approach (sources verified before writing)
- Strategic video placement (3 embeds at natural breaks)
- Reflection prompts (3 "Pause and Reflect" sections)
- Quality gates (4 checkpoints before publication)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Transformed 28 functional requirements into 9-section lesson architecture with 16 actionable tasks. Plan provides clear roadmap from approved spec to publication-ready chapter while preserving pedagogical integrity and constitutional alignment.
- 🧪 Tests: Constitutional compliance verified (Principles 1, 8 + Book Gaps Checklist). All functional requirements mapped to specific tasks. All success criteria made measurable with acceptance tests.
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md (166 lines, 7.7 KB), tasks.md (564 lines, 29 KB), IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (298 lines, 11 KB)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase. Use lesson-writer agent or assign to content author to begin Phase 1 (Content Structure). Estimated 60-75 hours total effort.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully decomposed complex narrative chapter into teachable units while maintaining story arc and engagement. Balanced multiple audience needs through progressive scaffolding. Quality gates ensure constitutional alignment throughout implementation. Timeline realistic for 1.5-2 weeks of focused content development.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Planning succeeded on first attempt with full constitutional compliance.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Constitutional alignment verified. All requirements addressed. Tasks are specific, measurable, and independently testable.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Used chapter-planner subagent for specialized lesson breakdown
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None needed. Proceed to implementation phase with lesson-writer agent.
