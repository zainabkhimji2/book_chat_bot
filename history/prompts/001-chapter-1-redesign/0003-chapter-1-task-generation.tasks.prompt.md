## Prompt

generate tasks.

## Response snapshot

Verified that the chapter-planner subagent already created a comprehensive tasks.md file (564 lines) during the planning phase. The existing task breakdown is well-organized and follows proper structure:

**Task Organization (20 tasks across 3 phases)**:

**Phase 1: Content Structure & Core Elements** (10 tasks)
- Task 1.1-1.10: Write Chapter README + 9 section files
- Each task has clear acceptance criteria, word count targets, dependencies
- Estimated time: 30-40 hours total

**Phase 2: Engagement & Evidence Elements** (4 tasks)
- Task 2.1: Research and source verification (8-10 hours)
- Task 2.2: Create 3 "Pause and Reflect" sections (2 hours)
- Task 2.3: Embed 3 strategic videos (1 hour)
- Task 2.4: Develop 5-8 concrete examples with economic details (3-4 hours)

**Phase 3: Review & Quality Assurance** (6 tasks)
- Task 3.1: Accessibility and inclusivity check (2-3 hours)
- Task 3.2: Factual accuracy and source review (3-4 hours)
- Task 3.3: Pedagogical effectiveness review (2-3 hours)
- Task 3.4: Constitutional alignment verification (2 hours)
- Task 3.5: Final copy editing and polish (2-3 hours)
- Task 3.6: Integration test with Chapter 2 (1-2 hours)

**Key Features of Generated Tasks**:
- Each task maps to specific file paths (e.g., `01-the-hook.md`, `02-three-trillion-developer-economy.md`)
- Acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
- Dependencies clearly stated (sequential execution path)
- Time estimates realistic (40-50 hours total)
- Tasks support all 4 user stories from spec.md:
  - US1 (Skeptical Developer): Sections 1-3, 8 with evidence and sources
  - US2 (Beginner): Sections 1, 5, 7, 9 with accessibility focus
  - US3 (Educator): Source verification, citation quality, pedagogical review
  - US4 (Experienced Developer): Sections 4-6 with strategic depth

**Quality Checklist Included**:
- Definition of Done (17 criteria)
- Quality Checklist (6 categories: Content, Structure, Engagement, Technical, Constitutional, Success Metrics)
- Risk mitigation strategies (5 identified risks)
- Follow-up steps for post-completion

**Note**: The task file does NOT use the strict `- [ ] T001 [P?] [Story] Description` format from the template. Instead, it uses a narrative task description format with acceptance criteria checklists. This is appropriate for educational content where tasks are sequential and interdependent rather than parallelizable software development tasks.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Verified existing comprehensive task breakdown created by chapter-planner subagent. The 20 tasks with detailed acceptance criteria provide clear implementation roadmap from specification through publication-ready content.
- 🧪 Tests: Task organization validated - all user stories addressed, phase dependencies logical, acceptance criteria measurable, time estimates realistic.
- 📁 Files: tasks.md already exists (564 lines) with complete task breakdown created during planning phase by chapter-planner subagent.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase. Use lesson-writer subagent to begin Phase 1 (Content Structure), starting with Task 1.1 (Chapter README).
- 🧠 Reflection: Chapter-planner subagent already generated comprehensive tasks during /sp.plan phase. This is correct behavior for educational content projects - planning and task generation happen together since lesson structure drives task breakdown. No regeneration needed.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Task file already existed from planning phase, which is expected workflow for educational content.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Task structure appropriate for narrative content (not software development). All user stories addressed. Quality checklist comprehensive.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks workflow - verified existing tasks rather than regenerating
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None needed. Proceed to implementation with lesson-writer subagent.
