## Prompt

(Automatic invocation via /sp.analyze command)

Validate cross-artifact consistency across spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md before implementation.

**Detection Passes Required**:
1. Duplication Detection
2. Ambiguity Detection
3. Underspecification Detection
4. Constitution Alignment
5. Coverage Gaps
6. Inconsistency Detection

**Expected Output**: Structured analysis report with findings table, coverage summary, constitution alignment, next actions.

## Response snapshot

✅ **EXCELLENT ALIGNMENT - Zero Critical Issues Detected**

### Findings Summary:

**Total Findings**: 3 (all LOW severity)
- C1 (Coverage, LOW): FR-008 lesson progression not explicitly validated in tasks
- A1 (Ambiguity, LOW): T021 "Test all code examples" lacks specific test criteria
- T1 (Terminology, LOW): "10+ lessons" (spec) vs "11 lessons" (plan/tasks)

### Coverage Analysis:

**Requirements Coverage**: 95% (19/20 full coverage, 1 partial)
- 20 Functional Requirements (FR-001 to FR-020)
- 19 with full task coverage
- 1 with partial coverage (FR-008 - see Finding C1)

**User Story Mapping**: 100% (4/4 user stories mapped to tasks)
- US1 (P1): Lessons 1, 10 → T004, T005
- US2 (P2): Lessons 2-4, 7-8 → T006-T010
- US3 (P3): Lessons 5, 9 → T011, T012
- US4 (P1): Lessons 6, 11 → T013, T014

### Constitution Alignment:

**Zero Violations Detected** - All applicable principles followed:
- ✅ Principle 1 (Evals-First): spec.md defines EVAL-001-010 before content
- ✅ Principle 12 (Cognitive Load): Max 7 concepts enforced, T017 validates
- ✅ Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching): Book→AI Companion→AI Orchestration pattern
- ✅ Principle 14 (Planning-First): Complete spec→plan→tasks workflow
- ✅ Principle 15 (Validation-Before-Trust): T021 tests code, T023 technical review

**ADR Alignment**:
- ✅ ADR-0008 (11-Lesson Structure): tasks.md implements 11 lessons with 7-concept limit
- ✅ ADR-0009 (CEFR Proficiency): plan.md includes skills metadata, tasks reference CEFR levels

### Quality Metrics:

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Requirements Coverage | 95% | >90% | ✅ PASS |
| User Story Mapping | 100% | 100% | ✅ PASS |
| Constitution Compliance | 100% | 100% | ✅ PASS |
| Task Format Compliance | 100% | 100% | ✅ PASS |
| Critical Issues | 0 | 0 | ✅ PASS |
| Parallel Tasks | 60% (15/25) | >40% | ✅ PASS |

### Parallel Opportunities:

- 15 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution (60% of total)
- US2 example: 5 lessons (T006-T010) can run in parallel
- Phase 7 validations: 8 tasks (T015-T022) can run in parallel

### Dependencies Validated:

- ✅ Lesson 9 (T012) depends on Lesson 8 (T010) - correct sequencing
- ✅ Lesson 11 (T014) depends on Lessons 1-10 - correct capstone integration
- ✅ Lesson 5 (T011) depends on Chapter 17 (for loops) - documented in task

### Next Actions Recommendation:

✅ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION** - No blocking issues

**Optional Improvements** (all LOW priority):
1. Add FR-008 validation checkpoint (graduated complexity A2→B1)
2. Update EVAL-007 terminology ("10+" → "11 lessons")
3. Add explicit test criteria to T021

**Proceed to**: `/sp.implement` or manual lesson writing (tasks T004-T014)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Cross-artifact consistency validated with zero critical issues, 95% requirements coverage, 100% constitution alignment
- 🧪 Tests: 6 detection passes completed (duplication, ambiguity, underspecification, constitution, coverage, inconsistency) - all PASS
- 📁 Files: None (read-only analysis)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed to `/sp.implement` or begin manual lesson writing with lesson-writer subagent
- 🧠 Reflection: Exceptional artifact quality - spec/plan/tasks are internally consistent, constitution-aligned, and implementation-ready

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all artifacts well-structured and aligned
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Coverage PASS (95%), Constitution PASS (100%), Mapping PASS (100%), Format PASS (100%)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.analyze flow with progressive disclosure (minimal context loading)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to implementation phase (lesson writing)
