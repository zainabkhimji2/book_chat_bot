## Prompt

Write Lesson 5: "List Comprehensions - Transforming Data" for Chapter 18 (Lists, Tuples, and Dictionary).

**Context**:
- **Specification**: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorgpt-build/ai-native-software-development/specs/001-part-4-chapter-18/spec.md`
- **Plan**: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorgpt-build/ai-native-software-development/specs/001-part-4-chapter-18/plan.md` (Lesson 5 section, lines 295-366)
- **Output Path**: `book-source/docs/04-Part-4-Python-Fundamentals/18-lists-tuples-dictionary/05-lesson-5.md`

**Task Details** (from tasks.md T011):
- **Content**: 6 concepts (comprehension syntax, expression evaluation, iteration variable, if filtering, readability considerations, nested comprehensions brief intro)
- **CEFR Level**: B1 (Intermediate)
- **Prerequisites**: Chapter 17 (for loops) - CRITICAL prerequisite
- **Code Examples**: EX-006 (loop vs comprehension side-by-side), EX-007 (filtering with if), EX-008 (readability examples)
- **Try With AI**: 4 prompts with Bloom's progression

**Requirements**:
1. Read spec.md and plan.md Lesson 5 section
2. Follow `.claude/output-styles/lesson.md` format
3. 6 concepts (within B1 limit), show loop-to-comprehension transformation
4. Emphasize readability: "clarity trumps cleverness"
5. WRITE FILE to output path

## Response snapshot

**Lesson 5 Written and Committed**

Lesson file created at: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorgpt-build/ai-native-software-development/book-source/docs/04-Part-4-Python-Fundamentals/18-lists-tuples-dictionary/05-lesson-5.md`

**Content Summary**:
- Opening hook: contrasts elegant Python with necessity of clarity
- Section 1: Loop-to-comprehension transformation (side-by-side comparison)
- Section 2: Syntax breakdown (three essential parts: expression, for, item, in, iterable)
- Section 3: Filtering with `if` conditions (gate model)
- Section 4: Combined expression+filtering (demonstrates order of operations)
- Section 5: Readability guidelines with "clarity trumps cleverness" principle
- Section 6: Brief nested comprehension intro (explicitly discourages except for simple cases)
- Try With AI: 4 prompts (Remember → Understand → Apply → Analyze) with expected outcomes

**Code Examples**:
- EX-010: Loop vs comprehension (side-by-side: `squares_loop` vs `squares_comp`)
- EX-011: Filtering with `if` (`evens` from `range(1,11)`)
- EX-012: Transform+filter combined (`evens_doubled`)
- 3 exercise sets (simple transforms, filtering, combined) with solutions

**CoLearning Elements**:
- 💬 AI Colearning Prompts: 2 (loop transformation, readability judgment)
- 🎓 Instructor Commentary: 1 (syntax vs intent)
- 🚀 CoLearning Challenge: 1 (vowel-starting words)
- ✨ Teaching Tips: 1 (use Claude Code for refactoring)

**YAML Frontmatter**:
- Skills metadata: 4 skills (comprehension syntax, filtering, loop translation, readability judgment)
- Proficiency levels: All B1 with appropriate Bloom's levels (Apply, Analyze, Evaluate)
- Cognitive load: 6 concepts documented (within B1 limit of 10)
- Learning objectives: 4 objectives aligned to plan
- Generation metadata: traced to spec.md, created 2025-11-09

## Outcome

- ✅ **Impact**: Lesson 5 complete and ready for chapter publication. Fills critical gap between list methods (Lesson 4) and tuple introduction (Lesson 6).

- 🧪 **Tests**:
  - Cognitive load validation: 6 concepts (within B1 limit) ✓
  - CEFR proficiency: B1 Apply/Analyze levels ✓
  - Code examples: All runnable (loop transforms, filtering, combined) ✓
  - CoLearning elements: 4 types present throughout ✓
  - Try With AI: 4 prompts with Bloom's progression ✓
  - Readability emphasis: "clarity trumps cleverness" core theme ✓

- 📁 **Files**:
  - Created: `/book-source/docs/04-Part-4-Python-Fundamentals/18-lists-tuples-dictionary/05-lesson-5.md` (632 lines, ~11.5 KB)
  - No edits needed to other files

- 🔁 **Next prompts**:
  - Validate with technical-reviewer for accuracy and best practices
  - If time: Write Lesson 6 (Tuples - Immutable Sequences)

- 🧠 **Reflection**:
  - Lesson balances conciseness with clarity emphasis (acknowledges comprehension elegance but prioritizes team communication)
  - Loop-to-comprehension transformation shown explicitly as learning bridge
  - Nested comprehensions discouraged (professional practice: readability > cleverness)
  - Try With AI section provides clear closure without "Key Takeaways" (constitutional adherence)
  - CoLearning elements distributed throughout (not concentrated at end)

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- **Failure modes observed**: None. Lesson written from spec without blockers.

- **Graders run and results**:
  - Cognitive load check: 6 new concepts (syntax, expression, iteration variable, if filtering, readability, nested brief) = within B1 limit ✓
  - Bloom's alignment: Apply (writing) → Analyze (converting) → Evaluate (readability) matches progression ✓
  - Constitutional compliance: AI-native framing, CoLearning elements, Try With AI closure ✓

- **Prompt variant**: N/A (single-pass generation successful)

- **Next experiment**: Ready for lesson-writer to move to Lesson 6 or technical reviewer to validate Lesson 5.
