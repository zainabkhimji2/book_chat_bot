## Prompt

Execute /sp.implement for Chapter 1: Invoke lesson-writer subagent to create Lessons 1-2 + foundational assets (MVP scope). After completion, pause for human review before proceeding to Lessons 3-6.

## Response snapshot

**Implementation Phase Initiated**:

Chapter 1 is ready for lesson-writer implementation. All prerequisites verified:
- ✅ Specification complete (16/16 checklist items)
- ✅ Lesson plan finalized (6 lessons, learning objectives, pedagogy)
- ✅ Task list ready (93 tasks, 10 phases, dependencies mapped)
- ✅ Chapter README prepared (integration guide, domain skills mapping)

**MVP Scope (30 tasks, Phase 1-4)**:
1. **Foundational Assets** (T006-T013): 5 diagrams + 3 example compilations
2. **Lesson 1** (T014-T023): "The Paradigm Shift: From Fear to Opportunity" (600-800 words)
3. **Lesson 2** (T024-T036): "The $3 Trillion Market and Technological Transformation" (1,000-1,200 words)

**Lesson 1 Content Structure**:
- Hook: "Will AI replace me?" — acknowledge fear directly
- Reframe: AI as amplifier (musician vs. conductor analogy)
- Examples: 2 solo builder stories with concrete ARR/team numbers
- Role intro: Preview "agent orchestrator" concept
- Closing: Establish psychological safety and opportunity
- Reflection exercise: "What about your skills could AI amplify?"
- Assessment: Learning outcomes + formative evaluation

**Lesson 2 Content Structure**:
- Opening: $3 trillion industry, 30 million developers scale
- The shift: Copilots (assistance) vs. Agents (autonomy)
- 4 Enablers (separate sections):
  1. Context Engineering
  2. Autonomous Agents
  3. Sandbox Execution
  4. Infrastructure Evolution
- Closing: Why this moment is genuine
- Visuals: Timeline diagram, 4 enablers diagram, code patterns
- Citations: All claims sourced to AI Coding Revolution Paper
- Assessment: Comprehension check + learning outcomes

**Foundational Assets** (reusable across all lessons):
- 5 Diagrams (markdown with ASCII/SVG):
  1. Musician vs. Conductor (amplification concept)
  2. Snakes & Ladders pattern (3-layer competition)
  3. Agent-Native Education (3 roles)
  4. Agent Orchestrator (4 dimensions)
  5. Book Journey (13 parts)
- 3 Examples (structured markdown):
  1. Solo builders (ARR, team size, domains)
  2. Vertical markets (finance, healthcare, education, legal)
  3. Code patterns (agent vs. copilot prompt-response)

**Quality Standards**:
- Show-Then-Explain pedagogy (examples → explanations)
- Heavy scaffolding (all terms defined, analogies, assumptions explained)
- Multiple entry points (narrative + bullets + visuals + examples)
- No forward references (self-contained or "Chapter X covers this")
- Constitutional alignment (Principles 1, 8, 9)
- All 8 domain skills integrated (learning-objectives, concept-scaffolding, code-example-generator, exercise-designer, assessment-builder, technical-clarity, book-scaffolding, ai-augmented-teaching)
- Accessibility (clear language, alt text on diagrams, visual contrast)
- Realistic examples with concrete numbers

**Human Review Gates**:
- ✅ Checkpoint 1 (after L1-L2): Review for clarity, accuracy, engagement, accessibility
- Content will NOT auto-proceed to Lessons 3-6 until human approval

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Chapter 1 ready for lesson-writer implementation. MVP scope (30 tasks) clearly defined. All foundational context prepared. Human review gates established at each lesson checkpoint.
- 🧪 Tests: Prerequisites check PASS; Checklist validation PASS (16/16); Task format PASS (all 93 tasks validated); Dependency mapping PASS; Success criteria mapping PASS
- 📁 Files: 5 core specification/planning files verified (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, README.md, requirements.md checklist)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Invoke lesson-writer subagent with MVP scope (T006-T036). After completion, pause for human review of L1+L2 before proceeding to L3-L6.
- 🧠 Reflection: Implementation strategy prioritizes rapid feedback (MVP scope), human review gates (quality assurance), and iterative refinement (feedback → L3-L6 task adjustment). All prerequisites verified. Chapter structure sound. Ready for content creation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None—all prerequisites complete, task structure verified, implementation context prepared
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Checklist status PASS (16/16); Task validation PASS (93 tasks); Prerequisite check PASS; MVP scope definition PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Lesson-writer prompt simplified to manage output token limits. Will require sequential task invocation if needed.
- Next experiment: Invoke lesson-writer subagent with MVP scope. Monitor output token usage. Use iterative task batching if needed (Foundational Assets first, then L1, then L2).
