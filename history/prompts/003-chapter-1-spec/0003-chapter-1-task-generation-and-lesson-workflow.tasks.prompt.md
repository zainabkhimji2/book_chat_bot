## Prompt

Create comprehensive tasks.md for Chapter 1 implementation with:
1. Lesson-based task organization (6 lessons, each independently reviewable)
2. Human review checkpoints after each lesson (not automatic progression)
3. Foundational assets phase (diagrams, examples, shared resources)
4. Parallel task opportunities (21 tasks can run simultaneously)
5. Clear dependencies and sequencing
6. 93 total tasks covering content, visuals, assessments
7. Assignment to lesson-writer agent with review gates

Key constraints:
- All tasks follow strict checklist format ([ID] [P?] [Lesson] Description)
- Each lesson independently testable and reviewable
- Main chapter README finalized by human after all lessons
- Technical-reviewer validates complete chapter
- MVP scope: Lessons 1-2 (22 tasks) for initial delivery

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive 456-line tasks.md with lesson-based implementation workflow:

**Task Organization** (93 total tasks):
- Phase 1: Setup (5 tasks) - Directory structure, templates
- Phase 2: Foundational Assets (8 tasks) - Diagrams, examples, code patterns (all parallelizable)
- Phase 3: Lesson 1 (10 tasks) - Paradigm Shift with human review checkpoint
- Phase 4: Lesson 2 (13 tasks) - Market Transformation with human review checkpoint
- Phase 5: Lesson 3 (13 tasks) - Vertical Opportunities with human review checkpoint
- Phase 6: Lesson 4 (12 tasks) - Agent-Native Education with human review checkpoint
- Phase 7: Lesson 5 (11 tasks) - Agent Orchestrator Role with human review checkpoint
- Phase 8: Lesson 6 (10 tasks) - Preview of Journey with human review checkpoint
- Phase 9: Chapter Integration (6 tasks) - Navigation, comprehension check, README finalization
- Phase 10: Technical Review (5 tasks) - Validation and polish

**Human Review Gates**:
- 6 lesson checkpoints (after each lesson completes)
- 1 chapter integration checkpoint (before technical review)
- 1 final technical review checkpoint (technical-reviewer subagent)

**Parallel Opportunities** (21 tasks):
- Foundational assets: All 8 tasks can run simultaneously
- Lesson 1: T016, T017 (example integration) parallelizable
- Lesson 2: T026-T029 (subsections) parallelizable; T032-T033 (visuals)
- Lesson 3: T040-T043 (4 vertical examples) parallelizable
- Lessons 4-6: Various diagram and section parallelization

**MVP Scope** (30 tasks):
- All foundational assets (8 tasks)
- Lesson 1 (10 tasks)
- Lesson 2 (13 tasks)
- Provides emotional foundation + market grounding for first human review

**Success Criteria Mapping**:
All 8 success criteria mapped to specific lessons and assessment methods:
- SC-001 (90%+ AI amplifies): L1 reflection + L4 comprehension
- SC-002 (85%+ explain 3+ shifts): L2 comprehension check
- SC-003 (80%+ identify vertical): L3 reflection + chapter exercise
- SC-004 (85%+ understand agent-native): L4 comprehension check
- SC-005 (90%+ feel motivated): L1 + L5 reflection
- SC-006 (80%+ explain orchestrator): L5 application exercise
- SC-007 (complete without confusion): Chapter comprehension check (4 questions)
- SC-008 (75%+ ready for Part 2): L6 reflection + chapter closing

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete, executable task list (93 tasks) ready for lesson-writer agent implementation. Human review gates established after each lesson. Clear path to chapter completion with iterative refinement.
- 🧪 Tests: All 93 tasks validated for format compliance, dependency correctness, parallel opportunities. MVP scope (30 tasks) identified and ready for first delivery.
- 📁 Files: tasks.md created (456 lines, 23KB) with complete implementation roadmap, dependency graph, parallel opportunities, and file structure.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Submit tasks.md + plan.md to lesson-writer subagent to implement Lessons 1-2 (MVP scope, 22 tasks). Pause for human review after completion.
- 🧠 Reflection: Task generation centered human review checkpoints as critical gates (not automatable). Each lesson independently testable ensures quality feedback before proceeding. Foundational assets parallelization (8 tasks) enables efficient resource use. MVP scope (Lessons 1-2) provides rapid feedback loop before committing to Lessons 3-6.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None—tasks.md complete with clear sequencing, dependencies, and review gates
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation PASS (all 93 tasks match checklist); Dependency mapping PASS; Parallel identification PASS; Success criteria mapping PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None needed—user intent was clear (lesson-based workflow with human review gates)
- Next experiment: Submit Lesson 1-2 MVP (22 tasks) to lesson-writer. Gather human feedback on pedagogical effectiveness, clarity, accessibility. Use feedback to refine Lessons 3-6 task requirements before implementation.
