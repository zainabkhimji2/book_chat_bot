## Prompt

Transform Chapter 1 specification into a detailed pedagogical lesson plan with:

1. Lesson-by-lesson breakdown (6 lessons, ~3,500-4,500 words total)
2. Learning objectives per lesson aligned to Bloom's taxonomy
3. Pedagogical structure for each lesson (Show → Explain → Practice → Assess)
4. Content scaffolding strategy (what builds on what, what is foundational)
5. Estimated time per lesson with cumulative budget
6. Integration of all 8 domain skills (learning-objectives, concept-scaffolding, code-example-generator, exercise-designer, assessment-builder, technical-clarity, book-scaffolding, ai-augmented-teaching)
7. README.md with main chapter outcomes, lesson summaries, pedagogical approach, and integration points

**Input Files**:
- `/specs/003-chapter-1-spec/spec.md` - Chapter 1 specification (FR, UC, success criteria, content structure)
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` - Project constitution (principles, domain skills, governance)
- `specs/003-chapter-1-spec/plan.md` - Empty plan template to be filled

**Output Files**:
- `specs/003-chapter-1-spec/plan.md` - Detailed 6-lesson plan with objectives, content, domain skill integration
- `specs/003-chapter-1-spec/README.md` - Chapter overview with learning outcomes, lesson summaries, scaffolding strategy

**Key Requirements**:
- Heavy scaffolding for beginners (define all terms, use analogies, multiple entry points)
- Lesson sequence must respect Lesson 1 as emotional foundation (safety/motivation before technical content)
- Every lesson must have single, measurable learning objective (Bloom's level)
- Show-Then-Explain pedagogy for all lessons (examples before explanations)
- All success criteria from spec must map to lesson assessments
- All 8 domain skills must be visibly integrated and explained

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive, pedagogically sound lesson plan consisting of:

**plan.md** (618 lines):
- 6-lesson architecture with Bloom's objectives, content outlines, pedagogical approaches, and domain skill integration per lesson
- Lesson sequence diagram showing dependencies and rationale
- 5-layer scaffolding strategy (emotional → cognitive → expectation → integration → preview)
- Assessment strategy (formative distributed throughout + summative at end)
- Visual resource specifications (5 required diagrams + code examples + solo builder examples + analogies)
- Domain skills integration summary table
- Constitution alignment verification
- Quality gate checklist (16/16 items verified before handoff)

**README.md** (364 lines):
- Chapter overview connecting to Part 1 and Parts 2-7
- 4 chapter-level learning outcomes (Knowledge, Application, Affective domains)
- 6 lesson summaries (Quick reference with focus, key concepts, visuals)
- Table showing how each lesson achieves chapter outcomes
- Pedagogical approach explanation (Show-Then-Explain)
- Integration points (within Part 1, across Parts 2-7)
- 5-layer scaffolding strategy with descriptions
- Domain skills applied (all 8 skills mapped to chapter content)
- Success metrics table with measurement methods and targets
- Constitution alignment with quotes from key principles
- Quality checklist (14/14 items verified before lesson-writer handoff)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Chapter 1 planning phase complete. Two comprehensive planning documents provide lesson-writer subagent with specific, actionable guidance for implementing 6 lessons. All pedagogical decisions documented with rationale.

- 🧪 Tests:
  - Quality gate checklist: 16/16 items verified for plan.md
  - Quality gate checklist: 14/14 items verified for README.md
  - Constitution alignment: Verified Principles 1, 5, 8, 9 explicitly addressed
  - Domain skills: All 8 skills mapped to specific lessons with visible integration
  - Lesson dependencies: Validated sequence from emotional foundation through integration through preview

- 📁 Files:
  - `specs/003-chapter-1-spec/plan.md` (618 lines, 28kb) - Complete lesson-by-lesson plan
  - `specs/003-chapter-1-spec/README.md` (364 lines, 16kb) - Chapter overview and integration guide

- 🔁 Next prompts:
  1. Lesson-writer subagent invocation with Lesson 1-2 implementation request
  2. Human review checkpoint after Lessons 1-2 complete
  3. Lesson-writer continues with Lessons 3-4
  4. Human review checkpoint after Lessons 3-4 complete
  5. Lesson-writer completes Lessons 5-6
  6. Technical-reviewer subagent validation of complete chapter
  7. Final human editorial review before publication

- 🧠 Reflection:
  - Successfully applied "chapter-planner" pedagogical architecture to Chapter 1 specification
  - Prioritized emotional/psychological foundation (Lesson 1) before technical content (Lessons 2-3)
  - Scaffolding strategy respects beginner audience and Principle 8 (Inclusivity)
  - All 8 domain skills integrated with specific, visible applications per lesson
  - Lesson dependencies clearly documented to prevent forward references or cognitive overload
  - Assessment strategy distributed (formative) and summative, aligned with spec success criteria
  - Planning ready for lesson-writer implementation with no ambiguity in objectives, content scope, or acceptance criteria

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Planning phase successful with clear, actionable outputs for next phase.

- Graders run and results:
  - ✅ Quality gate checklist (plan.md): 16/16 passed
  - ✅ Quality gate checklist (README.md): 14/14 passed
  - ✅ Lesson dependency validation: All 6 lessons sequenced logically with documented rationale
  - ✅ Domain skill integration: All 8 skills present in lesson architecture
  - ✅ Constitution alignment: Principles 1, 5, 8, 9 explicitly addressed with examples

- Prompt variant: None needed. Initial prompt produced complete, high-quality planning artifacts.

- Next experiment: Lesson-writer subagent will implement Lessons 1-2 following the detailed specifications in plan.md. Human reviewer will validate pedagogical quality, clarity, accessibility, and Constitution alignment. Iterative feedback will refine subsequent lessons.
