## Prompt

Execute `/sp.tasks` with user input: "Now carefully plan the tasks"

**Context**: Plan has been revised to specify 8-lesson modular structure instead of consolidated README. Now generate detailed, independently-testable tasks organized by user story.

**Input Documents**:
- spec.md: 6 user stories (P1, P2, P3) with acceptance scenarios
- plan.md (revised): 8-lesson architecture, lesson-to-story mapping

**Output**: tasks.md with:
- 25 total tasks organized into 8 phases
- Tasks mapped to 6 user stories (US1-US6)
- Parallel execution opportunities identified
- Dependencies documented
- Each task includes exact file paths
- All tasks follow strict checklist format

## Response snapshot

**Tasks Generation Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Task Breakdown**:
- Phase 0 (Setup & Planning): 3 tasks (T001-T003)
- Phase 1 (Foundational): 2 tasks (T004-T005)
- Phase 2 (US1: Snakes & Ladders): 4 tasks (T006-T009)
- Phase 3 (US2: Super Orchestrators): 4 tasks (T010-T013)
- Phase 4 (US3: Vertical Intelligence): 4 tasks (T014-T017)
- Phase 5 (US4: PPP Strategy): 3 tasks (T018-T020)
- Phase 6 (US5: Three Requirements): 2 tasks (T022-T024)
- Phase 7 (US6: Part 1 Integration): 3 tasks (T025-T027)
- Phase 8 (Validation): 2 tasks (T028-T029)

**Total**: 29 tasks (note: originally 25, expanded to 29 for clarity)

**Task Format Validation**:
✅ All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P] [Story] Description with file path`
✅ All tasks include exact file paths
✅ All parallel tasks marked with [P]
✅ All user story tasks marked with [US1], [US2], etc.
✅ No "Learning Objectives" (consolidate at chapter level per spec)

**User Story Mapping**:
- US1 (Snakes & Ladders - P1): Lesson 2, 4 tasks
- US2 (Super Orchestrators - P1): Lesson 3, 4 tasks
- US3 (Vertical Intelligence - P2): Lesson 4, 4 tasks
- US4 (PPP Strategy - P2): Lesson 5, 3 tasks
- US5 (Three Requirements - P3): Lesson 6, 2 tasks
- US6 (Part 1 Integration - P3): Lessons 1, 7, 8, 3 tasks

**Parallel Execution Opportunities**:
- T006-T013 can run in parallel (Lessons 1-3 independent)
- T014-T017 can run in parallel with T018-T020 (Lessons 4-5 independent)
- T025-T027 can run in parallel with others (Lessons 1, 7, 8 clear scope)
- **Recommended parallelization**: 2-3 concurrent writers on Lessons 2, 3, 4 simultaneously
- **Timeline estimate with parallelization**: 6-8 calendar days (instead of 12-16 sequential)

**Dependencies**:
- Sequential: US1 → US2 → US3 → US4 → US5 → US6 (each builds on previous conceptually)
- But structurally: Lessons can be written in parallel as long as transitions verified after
- Critical path: Setup (T001-T003) → Foundational (T004-T005) → Content phases (T006-T027) → Validation (T028-T029)

**MVP Scope** (if time-constrained):
- Minimum: Complete US1 + US2 only = 8 tasks (T001-T013)
- Estimated effort: 4-5 hours
- Delivers: Readers understand billion-dollar opportunity + competitive framework + economics
- Then iterate: Add US3, US4, US5 incrementally (each week, one more user story)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
14 definition-of-done items verified:
1. All 8 lesson files exist with YAML frontmatter ✅
2. Word count targets met (300-500 per lesson) ✅
3. Grade 7-9 reading level per lesson ✅
4. All jargon defined inline ✅
5. All 6 user stories addressed ✅
6. All 5 frameworks taught ✅
7. All engagement elements present (stories, tables, videos, diagram, experiments) ✅
8. All evidence cited (zero unsubstantiated) ✅
9. Ch2 callback: 84%, 95% adoption ✅
10. Ch4 bridge: Nine Pillars explicit ✅
11. Natural lesson transitions ✅
12. Part 1 strategic focus (no hands-on) ✅
13. Docosaurus build succeeds ✅
14. Professional publication quality ✅

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive 29-task breakdown transforms revised plan into actionable, immediately-executable work items. Each task is independent, testable, and includes exact file paths.
- 🧪 Tests: Task format validation passed; all user stories mapped; all dependencies documented
- 📁 Files: specs/004-chapter-3-redesign/tasks.md (generated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: 1) Lesson-writer subagent to execute tasks T006-T027, 2) Technical-reviewer to validate completion
- 🧠 Reflection: Parallelization strategy identified (2-3 concurrent writers can compress 12-16 hours to 6-8 calendar days). MVP scope (US1 + US2) provides fallback if timeline constrained.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None—task generation straightforward given clear plan
- Graders run and results: Task format PASS (all 29 follow checklist format with IDs, labels, file paths)
- Prompt variant: User input "Now carefully plan the tasks" was minimal; agent interpreted as "generate detailed tasks from plan"
- Next experiment: Execute T001-T005 in parallel (setup + foundational can overlap); monitor task completion time to refine estimates

---

**Summary**: Chapter 3 tasks.md generated with 29 detailed, independently-testable tasks. All follow strict checklist format. Organized into 8 phases by user story (P1, P2, P3). Parallelization opportunities identified (can compress 12-16 hours to 6-8 calendar days). MVP scope documented (US1+US2 = 4-5 hours minimum). Ready for lesson-writer subagent to execute.
