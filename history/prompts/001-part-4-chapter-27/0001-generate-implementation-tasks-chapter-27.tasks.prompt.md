## Prompt

/sp.tasks

Context: Continue from Phase 2 (Planning) completion. Generate implementation tasks checklist for Chapter 27: "Pydantic and Generics" based on approved spec.md and plan.md.

User input: "Proceed"

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive tasks.md with 169 tasks organized into 9 phases:

**Phase Structure:**
- Phase 1: Setup (4 tasks) - Chapter scaffolding
- Phase 2: Foundational (9 tasks) - All code examples tested
- Phase 3-8: Lessons 1-6 (142 tasks) - One phase per lesson, independently completable
- Phase 9: Polish & Validation (14 tasks) - Technical review and compliance

**Key Features:**
- Tasks organized by lesson (not user story, adapted for educational content)
- Each lesson independently completable with human review checkpoint
- 27 parallel tasks marked [P] for efficiency
- All 169 tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Lesson?] Description with file path`
- CEFR proficiency progression validated: B1 (L1, L3) → B1-B2 (L2, L4, L5) → B2 (L6)
- Constitutional requirements embedded: lesson closure pattern, CoLearning element positioning, no SDD references

**Lesson Breakdown:**
- Lesson 1 (21 tasks): Pydantic Introduction (B1)
- Lesson 2 (23 tasks): Advanced Pydantic (B1-B2)
- Lesson 3 (22 tasks): Generics Introduction (B1)
- Lesson 4 (24 tasks): Generic Classes (B1-B2)
- Lesson 5 (24 tasks): AI-Native Integration (B2)
- Lesson 6 (28 tasks): Capstone Config Manager (B2)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created actionable implementation roadmap for 6-lesson chapter with 169 specific, executable tasks
- 🧪 Tests: No code tests (educational content); validation tasks included in Phase 9 (technical-reviewer invocation)
- 📁 Files: 1 created (tasks.md), dependencies on spec.md and plan.md (already exist)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Invoke /sp.implement to execute lesson creation with lesson-writer subagent
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully adapted software feature task template to educational content structure; lessons map cleanly to user story pattern (independent, incrementally deliverable)

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - template adaptation for educational content executed correctly
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Self-validation PASS - all 169 tasks follow checklist format, lesson organization clear, constitutional requirements embedded
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (first execution)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - tasks.md ready for implementation phase
