## Prompt

User approved plans for both chapters and commanded "Proceed to P3" (Phase 3: Tasks Generation).

**Context**:
- Two approved lesson plans (Chapter 24 and Chapter 25)
- Feature branch 020-oop-part-1-2 created
- All planning validation checks passed in Phase 2
- CEFR proficiency levels assigned
- CoLearning pedagogy integrated

**Tasks Requirements**:
- Generate actionable implementation checklist (tasks.md)
- Organize tasks by Learning Journey (educational equivalent of user stories)
- Include dependency graph and parallel execution opportunities
- Define MVP strategy
- Ensure cross-chapter dependencies explicit
- Map tasks to specific lesson files and sections

## Response snapshot

**Phase 3: Tasks Generation (COMPLETE)**

Created comprehensive implementation checklist with 195 tasks organized into 12 phases:

**Organization Structure**:
- Phase 1: Setup & Prerequisites (4 tasks)
- Phase 2: Foundational Infrastructure (6 tasks)
- Phases 3-6: Chapter 24 Learning Journeys (75 tasks total)
  - LJ1: OOP Fundamentals (Lessons 1-2) - 20 tasks
  - LJ2: Constructors & Attributes (Lesson 3) - 18 tasks
  - LJ3: Encapsulation & Methods (Lesson 4) - 19 tasks
  - LJ4: Game Character Capstone (Lesson 5) - 18 tasks
- Phases 7-11: Chapter 25 Learning Journeys (96 tasks total)
  - LJ1: Inheritance & MRO (Lesson 1) - 22 tasks
  - LJ2: Polymorphism & Duck Typing (Lesson 2) - 18 tasks
  - LJ3: Composition & Modules (Lesson 3) - 16 tasks
  - LJ4: Special Methods (Lesson 4) - 22 tasks
  - LJ5: Design Patterns Capstone (Lesson 5) - 18 tasks
- Phase 12: Polish & Quality Assurance (14 tasks)

**Key Features**:
- Strict checklist format: `- [ ] T### [P] [LJ#-CH##] Description with file path`
- 23 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
- Dependency graph: Setup → Foundational → Ch24 LJ1-4 → Ch25 LJ1-5 → Polish
- MVP strategy defined for each chapter
- Cross-chapter dependency enforced (Ch24 completion required before Ch25)

**Total**: 195 actionable tasks with explicit acceptance criteria and file paths

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Production-ready implementation checklist with educational workflow adaptation
- 🧪 Tests: Task organization PASS, dependency graph PASS, MVP strategy PASS, cross-chapter dependencies PASS
- 📁 Files: tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: "Proceed to Phase 4: /sp.implement"
- 🧠 Reflection: Learning Journey organization makes educational content tasks more intuitive than software feature tasks

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All validation checks PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.implement with lesson-writer subagent
