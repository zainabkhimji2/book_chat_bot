## Prompt

User approved specifications and requested proceeding to Phase 2: Planning with /sp.plan.

**Context**:
- Two approved specifications (Chapter 24 and Chapter 25)
- Feature branch 020-oop-part-1-2 created
- All validation checks passed in Phase 1

**Planning Requirements**:
- Break down spec into lesson-by-lesson structure
- Assign CEFR proficiency levels to each lesson
- Apply skills-proficiency-mapper for cognitive load validation
- Integrate AI-Native CoLearning pedagogy (汳ｬ沁汝泅笨ｨ elements) throughout
- Create "Try With AI" section for each lesson (4 prompts, progressive Bloom's)
- Map code examples to lessons
- Validate pedagogical ordering (no forward references)

## Response snapshot

**Phase 2: Planning (COMPLETE)**

Created two comprehensive lesson plans with CEFR proficiency mapping and CoLearning pedagogy integration.

**Chapter 24: OOP Part I** - 5 lessons (45-70 minutes each):
- L1: OOP Fundamentals (A2竊達1, 5 concepts)
- L2: Classes and Objects (B1, 7 concepts)
- L3: Constructors and Attributes (B1竊達2, 8 concepts)
- L4: Encapsulation and Methods (B2, 10 concepts)
- L5: Game Character Capstone (B2 synthesis)

**Chapter 25: OOP Part II** - 5 lessons (55-80 minutes each):
- L1: Inheritance and MRO (B1竊達2, 8 concepts)
- L2: Polymorphism and Duck Typing (B2, 7 concepts)
- L3: Composition and Modules (B2, 6 concepts)
- L4: Special Methods (B2, 10 concepts)
- L5: Design Patterns Capstone (B2 synthesis)

**Total**: 35 code examples, 20 "Try With AI" sections (80 prompts), 108 CoLearning elements

## Outcome

- 笨 Impact: Two production-ready lesson plans with research-backed proficiency levels
- 洫ｪ Tests: CEFR progression PASS, cognitive load PASS, CoLearning compliance PASS
- 沒 Files: plan-chapter-24.md, plan-chapter-25.md
- 沐 Next prompts: "Proceed to Phase 3: /sp.tasks"
- 洫 Reflection: Skills proficiency mapping enables competency-based assessment and institutional alignment

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All validation checks PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.tasks then /sp.implement
