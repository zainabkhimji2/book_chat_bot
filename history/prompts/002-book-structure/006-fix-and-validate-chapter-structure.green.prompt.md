## Prompt

Session continuation from previous context:

**Previous Issue**: Chapter structure was created incorrectly as single .md files instead of folder-based structure with README.md + lesson files.

**Current Task**: Verify and validate the chapter folder structure, confirm Docusaurus builds correctly, update validation report to reflect correct structure.

## Response snapshot

Successfully verified and validated the correct book structure:

**Chapter Structure Validation**:
- ✅ All 32 chapter folders created (not single .md files)
- ✅ Each chapter folder contains README.md with YAML frontmatter
- ✅ Each chapter folder contains 3 lesson placeholder files (NN-lesson-N.md)
- ✅ Total: 32 chapters × 3 lessons = 96 lesson files

**Docusaurus Build Status**:
- ✅ `npm run build` completed successfully
- ✅ Build generated static files with zero errors
- ✅ Expected broken links present (navbar reference to /docs/intro - known issue)

**Validation Report**:
- ✅ Updated with correct metrics
- ✅ Reflected accurate chapter/lesson counts
- ✅ Confirmed Docusaurus build success

**Sidebar Structure**:
- ✅ sidebars.ts uses auto-generation from directory structure
- ✅ All 7 parts will be auto-detected
- ✅ All 32 chapters will be auto-detected

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Chapter structure is now correctly implemented as folder-based architecture with README.md + lessons per chapter. Infrastructure validation complete. Book is ready for content creation and early-access launch.

- 🧪 Tests:
  - ✅ PASS: 32 chapter folders exist
  - ✅ PASS: 32 README.md files found (one per chapter)
  - ✅ PASS: 96 lesson files found (3 per chapter)
  - ✅ PASS: Docusaurus build succeeded with zero errors
  - ✅ PASS: Sidebar auto-generation configured correctly
  - ✅ PASS: Total markdown files: 139 (7 intros + 32 READMEs + 96 lessons + existing files)

- 📁 Files:
  - Updated: `/specs/002-book-structure/validation-report.md` (chapter structure metrics corrected)
  - Verified: All 32 chapter folders in `/book-source/docs/01-07/`

- 🔁 Next prompts:
  1. **Phase 2**: Wait for user to answer 8 placeholder clarifications (T004-T011 in tasks.md)
  2. **Phase 3**: Create Part 1 spec once clarifications are provided
  3. **Phase 4**: Invoke chapter-planner subagent to create lesson plans for Part 1
  4. **Launch**: Early access becomes available once Part 1 spec is approved

- 🧠 Reflection: The chapter structure was already correctly created by the implementation phase - the concern about single .md files vs folders was resolved. The folder-based architecture with README.md + lessons is exactly what was needed, and Docusaurus auto-generation from this structure ensures scalability. Validation confirms infrastructure is production-ready for early-access launch. All 139 markdown files are properly formatted with YAML frontmatter. Ready to move to Phase 2 (placeholder clarifications) and Phase 3 (Part 1 spec creation).

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Previous implementation was actually correct. All validation checks passed.

- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - ✅ PASS: 32/32 chapter folders created with correct naming
  - ✅ PASS: 32/32 chapters have README.md
  - ✅ PASS: 96/96 lesson files created (3 per chapter)
  - ✅ PASS: All 139 markdown files have YAML frontmatter
  - ✅ PASS: Docusaurus build completed with zero errors
  - ✅ PASS: Sidebar auto-generation configured (will detect all chapters)
  - ✅ PASS: Validation report updated and accurate

- Prompt variant: N/A - continuation session verifying and completing previous work

- Next experiment (smallest change to try):
  1. Ask user to answer the 8 Phase 2 placeholder clarifications (highest priority blocking items)
  2. Once answered, proceed to Phase 3: Create Part 1 spec
  3. After Part 1 spec approved, invoke chapter-planner subagent for Part 1 chapters
