## Prompt

Design chapter 2. Now we will design and finally complete chapter 2 of our book. Currently we have placeholders in specs/part-1/part-1-spec.md and specs/book/chapter-index.md and in book-source. This chapter shall be designed from the following source content context/03_chap2_spec/. Use the specialized domain skills and the chapter-writer subagent.

## Response snapshot

Successfully created comprehensive specification for Chapter 2: "Understanding AI Tools: The Nine Revolutions That Made This Possible"

**Key Deliverables:**
1. Created feature branch `001-chapter-2` and specification document at `specs/001-chapter-2/spec.md`
2. Defined 4 prioritized user stories (P1-P3) covering technological foundations, tool comparisons, development patterns, and industry evidence
3. Specified 12 functional requirements ensuring comprehensive coverage of nine revolutions, four major AI coding agents, and methodological distinctions
4. Established 10 measurable success criteria targeting 80-90% reader comprehension and engagement
5. Identified 5 major risks with detailed mitigation strategies
6. Provided stakeholder decision points on depth vs. breadth, tool coverage, chapter length, exercise design, and "vibe coding" emphasis
7. Created concept hierarchy (4 levels) to guide lesson planning and content scaffolding

**Chapter Structure:**
- **Part I: Nine Technological Revolutions** (2020-2025) - Explains the convergence that made AI-driven development possible
- **Part II: AI Coding Agents** - Compares Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, and Qwen Code with practical selection criteria
- **Cross-Cutting Themes**: Three-layer stack architecture, Snakes and Ladders competitive pattern, Vibe Coding vs. SDD distinction, DORA perspective on AI as amplifier

**Pedagogical Approach:**
- Maintains Part 1 philosophy: LIGHT cognitive load, HEAVY scaffolding, zero gatekeeping language
- Targets 4,000-5,000 words with 20-30 minute reading time
- Includes visual aids (timelines, comparison tables, architecture diagrams) for multi-modal learning
- Provides end-of-chapter exercises connecting theory to application

**Constitution Alignment:**
- Applies all 8 domain skills as mandated
- Follows show-then-explain pedagogical pattern
- Grounds all claims in quantitative evidence (surveys, benchmarks, enterprise data)
- Ensures accessibility (alt text, high contrast, clear language)

**Next Steps:**
1. Invoke chapter-planner subagent to create lesson breakdown and task checklist
2. Invoke lesson-writer subagent to write actual content
3. Invoke technical-reviewer subagent to validate against constitution and quality standards

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive specification created that bridges Chapter 1's mindset shift with Chapter 3's hands-on setup; provides clear roadmap for implementing Chapter 2 content
- 🧪 Tests: Specification includes 10 measurable success criteria and 4 user stories with acceptance scenarios to validate learning outcomes
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-chapter-2/spec.md (approximately 8,500 words) and feature branch 001-chapter-2
- 🔁 Next prompts: (1) Invoke chapter-planner subagent with approved spec, (2) Review stakeholder questions for final direction, (3) Execute lesson-writer workflow
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully synthesizes two distinct source documents (academic paper + developer narrative) into unified pedagogical approach; concept hierarchy and risk mitigation strategies provide strong foundation for implementation phase

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None during specification phase; potential risks identified and mitigated in spec (information overload, tool obsolescence, reader skipping, skepticism, visual accessibility)
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Specification quality checklist pending (will be created during validation phase per workflow)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify command with feature description and source material references
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider splitting Chapter 2 into two shorter chapters if stakeholder review indicates 4,000-5,000 word target is insufficient for comprehensive coverage
