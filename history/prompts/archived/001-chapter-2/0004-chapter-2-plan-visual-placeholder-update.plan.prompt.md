## Prompt

Update the generated plan with the idea to add placeholders for visuals as we don't have visuals for now. We'll add them later.

## Response snapshot

Updated Chapter 2 implementation plan to incorporate **visual placeholder strategy** for efficient content-first workflow.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Added Visual Placeholder Guidelines** (new section in Lesson Writing Guidelines):
   - Standardized placeholder format with HTML comments and markdown structure
   - Clear rules for when and how to insert placeholders
   - Example showing placeholder in narrative flow
   - Special guidance for comparison tables (can be markdown tables immediately)

2. **Updated Visual Assets Required Section**:
   - Added note at top explaining placeholder approach
   - Provided complete placeholder format specification
   - Included working example of placeholder usage
   - All 9 visual assets retain their specifications for future design work

3. **Enhanced Next Steps After Planning**:
   - Clarified that lessons will use visual placeholders initially
   - Added Step 6: Future Visual Asset Creation Phase (separate workflow)
   - Explained that visual creation can proceed in parallel with other chapters
   - Made workflow non-blocking on visual design resources

4. **Added Visual Asset Strategy Section** (in Notes & Decisions):
   - Documented decision rationale (allows immediate content writing)
   - Explained triple-purpose of placeholder text: placeholder content, design specs, alt text
   - Listed benefits: no blocking dependencies, validate content before visual investment
   - Implementation details: 9 assets specified, comparison tables functional markdown

**Placeholder Format Specified**:
```markdown
<!-- VISUAL PLACEHOLDER: [Asset-Name] -->
**[Asset Title]**

[Comprehensive text description serving as placeholder, design spec, and alt text]

*[Visual will be added in design phase]*
<!-- END VISUAL PLACEHOLDER -->
```

**Key Benefits of This Approach**:
- ✅ Content writing can proceed immediately without waiting for visual design
- ✅ Placeholder descriptions ensure readers understand concepts even without graphics
- ✅ Text descriptions serve as specifications for future visual design work
- ✅ Enables parallel workflows: content team writes while design team plans visuals
- ✅ Reduces iteration risk: finalize content first, then create matching visuals
- ✅ Comparison tables can be functional markdown immediately (no graphical design needed)

**Workflow Impact**:
- Lesson-writer subagent can now complete all 4 lessons without blocking
- Visual creation becomes separate phase after content approval
- Technical-reviewer can validate content completeness independent of visuals
- Visual design phase can run in parallel with other chapter development

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Plan updated to enable non-blocking workflow; content creation decoupled from visual design without sacrificing quality or accessibility
- 🧪 Tests: Placeholder format ensures accessibility requirements met (text descriptions serve as alt text when visuals added)
- 📁 Files: Updated specs/001-chapter-2/plan.md with 3 new sections and enhanced Next Steps
- 🔁 Next prompts: (1) Proceed with /sp.tasks to generate implementation checklist, (2) Invoke lesson-writer with updated plan, (3) Visual creation after content approval
- 🧠 Reflection: Visual placeholder approach is practical solution for content-first development; triple-purpose text descriptions (placeholder + spec + alt text) maximize value while minimizing rework; this pattern could be reused for other chapters

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None; placeholder approach is standard practice in content development workflows
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A for plan updates; validation occurs during lesson writing and technical review phases
- Prompt variant (if applicable): User-initiated plan refinement based on resource availability
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider whether placeholder format should include additional metadata (priority, complexity estimate, design notes) for visual creation phase planning
