## Prompt

Generate plan

Context: User requested plan generation for Chapter 6 following successful specification approval. The /sp.plan command was triggered to transform the approved spec into detailed lesson plans and implementation tasks.

## Response snapshot

Successfully invoked chapter-planner subagent to generate comprehensive planning artifacts for Chapter 6: Gemini CLI: Installation and Basics.

**Planning Outputs Created**:

1. **tasks.md** (620 lines, 24KB) - Implementation checklist with 40+ discrete, testable tasks organized into 7 phases:
   - Phase 1: Chapter foundation (7 tasks - lesson outlines, learning objectives)
   - Phase 2: Lesson writing (35+ tasks across 6 lessons)
   - Phase 3: Code verification (8 tasks - test all commands on Windows/Mac/Linux)
   - Phase 4: Exercises & assessment (6 tasks - design hands-on activities)
   - Phase 5: Cross-cutting concerns (5 tasks - accessibility, style consistency)
   - Phase 6: Integration (4 tasks - cross-chapter verification)
   - Phase 7: Review & finalization (7 tasks - quality gates)

2. **plan.md** - Detailed lesson architecture with 6 lessons:
   - Lesson 1: Why Gemini CLI Matters (15-18 min)
   - Lesson 2: Installation — Platform-Specific Walkthroughs (25-30 min)
   - Lesson 3: Authentication & Configuration (15-20 min)
   - Lesson 4: Your First Commands (20-25 min)
   - Lesson 5: Built-In Tools Deep Dive (25-30 min)
   - Lesson 6: The 1M Token Context Window & Tool Comparison (20-25 min)

**Specification Coverage**:
- ✅ All 7 user stories mapped to specific lessons
- ✅ All 15 functional requirements assigned to lesson content
- ✅ All 10 success criteria have verification strategies
- ✅ Platform coverage (Windows/Mac/Linux) in installation lesson
- ✅ Hands-on verification commands throughout
- ✅ Cross-chapter integration with Chapters 5, 7, 8

**Pedagogical Approach**:
- Progressive scaffolding (moderate support for Part 2)
- Show-then-explain methodology (working examples first)
- Real command execution (learners run actual Gemini CLI commands)
- Platform equality (equal detailed guidance for all OS)
- Integration throughout (references to Chapter 5, preparation for Chapters 7-8)

**Domain Skills Applied**: All 9 CoLearning skills referenced (learning-objectives, concept-scaffolding, code-example-generator, exercise-designer, assessment-builder, technical-clarity, book-scaffolding, ai-augmented-teaching, content-evaluation-framework)

**Constitutional Alignment**: Validated against all core principles (AI-first teaching, accessibility, show-then-explain, progressive complexity, tool diversity, hands-on practice, testing mindset, real-world context)

**Total Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours (aligns with Part 2 specification)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete, detailed lesson plan and task checklist ready for lesson-writer implementation phase
- 🧪 Tests: Constitutional alignment verified, all specification requirements mapped, pedagogical approach validated
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md (lesson architecture) and tasks.md (40+ implementation tasks, 620 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Execute lesson-writer subagent to implement each of 6 lessons following the detailed plan and tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Planning demonstrates strong pedagogical design with clear progressive scaffolding (heavy support for installation, lighter support for decision-making), comprehensive platform coverage, and effective integration with adjacent chapters. The 6-lesson structure balances depth (Built-In Tools Deep Dive) with breadth (Tool Comparison Framework) while maintaining learner engagement through hands-on verification at every step.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - planning workflow executed successfully with chapter-planner subagent
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitutional alignment check - PASS; Specification coverage check - PASS; Pedagogical approach validation - PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.plan invocation with chapter-planner subagent
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Implement Lesson 1 using lesson-writer subagent to validate whether plan provides sufficient detail for content creation
