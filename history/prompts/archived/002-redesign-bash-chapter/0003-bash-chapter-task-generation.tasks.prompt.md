## Prompt

Breakdown and carefully plan the tasks for each chapter. Remember the core is to teach using this approach rather just commands list or tables:

```
You: "Show me my current directory path"
Agent: Tool -> Shell $ pwd
Tool Output: Users/mjs/Documents
Agent: "You are in Users/mjs/Documents directory."
```

## Response snapshot

✅ **Comprehensive Task List Created**

**File**: `/specs/002-redesign-bash-chapter/tasks.md` (400+ lines)

**Structure**: 68 actionable tasks organized by 7 user stories from specification

**Phases**:
- Phase 1: Setup (5 tasks)
- Phase 2: Foundational (10 tasks)
- Phases 3-9: User Stories 1-7 (43 tasks total, 6-9 per story)
- Phase 10: Integration (7 tasks)
- Phase 11: Polish (10 tasks)
- Phase 12: Deployment (8 tasks)

**Key Metrics**:
- Total tasks: 68
- Parallelizable tasks: 23 (marked [P])
- User story tasks: 43 (mapped [US1] through [US7])
- Setup/foundational tasks: 15
- Integration/polish tasks: 10

**User Story Coverage**:
- US1 (P1): File Navigation - 4 tasks (Lessons 1, 3)
- US2 (P1): File Operations - 4 tasks (Lessons 2, 4)
- US3 (P1): Configuration - 3 tasks (Lesson 5)
- US4 (P2): Packages - 3 tasks (Lesson 6)
- US5 (P2): Process Management - 2 tasks (Lesson 8 section)
- US6 (P2): Pipes & Complex Commands - 3 tasks (Lesson 7)
- US7 (P1): Safety Culture - 9 tasks (reinforced in all lessons)

**Dialogue-First Focus**: Every task emphasizes authentic dialogue examples from real Claude Code/Gemini CLI interactions, NOT isolated command syntax teaching

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Transformed specification and plan into 68 executable tasks enabling parallel content creation; each user story independently testable and deployable
- 🧪 Tests: All validation checkpoints defined (T019, T023, T026, T029, T031, T034, T043, T057)
- 📁 Files: Generated tasks.md (400+ lines); organized by phase, user story, parallel opportunities
- 🔁 Next prompts: lesson-writer subagent to implement lessons; technical-reviewer to validate authenticity
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks successfully capture dialogue-first philosophy while maintaining pedagogical rigor. Implementation can start with MVP (US1 only) then add iteratively or in parallel by multiple writers

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Task list addresses all specification requirements and learning objectives.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation PASS (all tasks follow checklist); user story mapping PASS (7 stories with clear task boundaries); parallel opportunities PASS (23 tasks marked [P])
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Original specification preserved; plan elaborated; tasks derived directly from both
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): During implementation, validate that lesson writers maintain dialogue authenticity (not synthesizing artificial examples)
