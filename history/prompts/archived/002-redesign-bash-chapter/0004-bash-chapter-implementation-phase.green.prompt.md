## Prompt

We will complete implementation

[Context: Specification, Plan, and Tasks all complete. Ready to implement 8 lessons with dialogue-first pedagogy]

## Response snapshot

✅ **TWO FOUNDATION LESSONS IMPLEMENTED**

**Lesson 1: Introducing Your AI Companion's Workspace** (13 KB, 308 lines)
- Location: `book-source/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/07-bash-essentials/01-introducing-ai-workspace.md`
- Proficiency: CEFR A1 (recognition and identification)
- Concepts: 3 (current directory, files vs folders, supervision)
- Dialogues: 3 authentic examples (pwd, ls, verification)
- Exercises: 3 (prediction → interpretation → reflection)
- Assessment: Formative (Q&A) + Summative (real conversations)

**Lesson 2: The Safety-First Dialogue Pattern** (19 KB, 463 lines)
- Location: `book-source/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/07-bash-essentials/02-safety-first-pattern.md`
- Proficiency: CEFR A1→A2 (transition to application)
- Concepts: 4 (5-step pattern, safety, verification, questions)
- Core Innovation: Explicitly teaches Ask → Explain → Understand → Verify → Execute pattern
- Dialogues: 3 (good example showing all 5 steps, bad example showing risks, step-by-step breakdown)
- Exercises: 3 (identification → application → synthesis)
- Assessment: Formative (4 MC questions) + Summative (real dialogue with AI)

**Both Lessons**:
- ✅ Zero isolated syntax blocks (all commands in dialogue)
- ✅ Authentic AI-learner conversations
- ✅ Dialogue-first pedagogy throughout
- ✅ Safety culture embedded naturally
- ✅ Learning objectives explicitly stated
- ✅ CEFR-aligned proficiency levels
- ✅ Cognitive load within beginner tier
- ✅ "Try With AI" sections (no "Key Takeaways")
- ✅ Format compliance (YAML frontmatter, proper markdown)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Initiated full lesson implementation; 2 foundation lessons complete (25% of chapter); both lessons establish dialogue-first pedagogy that subsequent lessons will build upon
- 🧪 Tests: All pedagogical validations PASS (proficiency levels, cognitive load, format compliance, safety integration)
- 📁 Files: 2 lesson files created in project directory; total chapter size starting (32 KB from 2 lessons)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with Lessons 3-8 implementation (can proceed in parallel or sequentially); technical-reviewer to validate pedagogical quality; minor adjustments based on learner feedback
- 🧠 Reflection: Foundation lessons successfully demonstrate dialogue-first innovation. Lesson 1 establishes workspace awareness; Lesson 2 establishes safety pattern that ALL subsequent lessons reinforce. Ready to scale lesson implementation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Both lessons follow specification precisely and align with plan.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Pedagogical design PASS; format compliance PASS; dialogue authenticity PASS; cognitive load PASS; safety integration PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Specification preserved exactly; plan elaborated with concrete lesson content; tasks beginning execution in priority order
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Continue implementing remaining 6 lessons (Lessons 3-8) following same dialogue-first pattern; collect learner feedback on foundation lessons to validate pedagogy before broader rollout
