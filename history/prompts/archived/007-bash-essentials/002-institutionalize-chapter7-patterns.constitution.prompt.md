## Prompt

Reflect on the Chapter 7 redesign process. We successfully demonstrated 7 key behavioral patterns for teaching non-programmers with reduced cognitive load and AI-as-partner framing:

1. **Cognitive Load Management** — Reduced from 4 package managers to 2; removed edge cases; explicit "agent chooses" language
2. **Concept-First Pattern** — Added "What Are Dependencies?" section; concept before commands
3. **AI-as-Partner** — Positioned agent as decision-maker; student learns concepts
4. **Error Literacy** — Red Flags section distinguishing normal from problematic
5. **Non-Programmer Accessibility** — No jargon assumptions; real-world analogies
6. **Practical Scenarios** — Focused on next 2 chapters only; removed theoretical scenarios
7. **Business/Product Focus** — Connected to shipping outcomes, not technical mastery

These patterns worked in Chapter 7. Now we need to institutionalize them so they apply consistently across all future beginner-focused chapters.

**Questions to answer:**
- Where should these patterns live? (Constitution? CLAUDE.md? Agents?)
- What's the minimal set of updates needed to guarantee future chapters follow this approach?
- How do we enforce these patterns in the lesson-writer agent?

## Response snapshot

### Constitution Changes
Added **Principle 12: Cognitive Load Consciousness**
- Content deliberately structured to reduce cognitive overload
- Max 2 options for beginners, max 5 concepts per section
- "Let AI handle complexity; students understand concepts"
- Referenced Chapter 5 example (npm + pip, removed brew/apt)

Added **Principle 13: Concept-Before-Command Pattern**
- WHAT → WHY → HOW → PRACTICE structure
- Non-programmer examples and analogies
- Visual diagrams for complex concepts
- Referenced Chapter 5 example (dependencies explanation before commands)

Extended **Principle 8: Accessibility** with Error Literacy
- Every technical lesson MUST include "Red Flags to Watch"
- Distinguish ✅ normal from ⚠️ problematic messages
- Empower students: "Error messages are learning tools"

### CLAUDE.md New Section
Added **Beginner Content Creation Guidelines**
Six subsections covering:
1. Cognitive Load Management (thresholds with examples)
2. Concept-First Pattern (WHAT/WHY/HOW/PRACTICE structure with Chapter 5 example)
3. AI-as-Partner Pattern (phrases to use; student responsibilities)
4. Error Literacy for Beginners (Red Flags pattern with examples)
5. Practical Context Over Theory (what to include/exclude)
6. Audience Context Matters (table: business founder vs. professional vs. student)

### Lesson-Writer Agent Update
Added **Beginner Content Only checklist** (12 items):
- Concept before commands
- Max 2 options; max 5 concepts
- Simplified first; advanced secondary
- Non-programmer examples and analogies
- Realistic scenarios (next 2 chapters only)
- Red Flags section with ✅/⚠️ distinction
- AI-as-partner framing
- Business/product context
- No assumptions about background
- Error literacy teaching
- Cognitive load management
- Anxiety reduction

## Outcome

- ✅ **Impact**: Chapter 7 patterns are now institutionalized. Future beginner chapters have clear guidelines and enforced checklists. Consistency guaranteed.

- 🧪 **Tests**:
  - Constitution updated with 2 new principles + extended principle 8
  - CLAUDE.md has 6-point beginner guidelines section with examples
  - lesson-writer agent has 12-item beginner checklist in self-validation

- 📁 **Files**:
  - `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (3 sections added/updated)
  - `CLAUDE.md` (new Beginner Content Guidelines section, 155+ lines)
  - `.claude/agents/lesson-writer.md` (12-item beginner checklist added)

- 🔁 **Next prompts**:
  - Update `concept-scaffolding` skill with beginner-specific guidance
  - Update `technical-clarity` skill with beginner checklist
  - Apply beginner patterns to Chapter 8+ lessons

- 🧠 **Reflection**:
  We went from "Chapter 7 works well" to "Chapter 7 patterns are now governance artifacts." The patterns are now part of the constitution (principles), the development guidelines (CLAUDE.md), and the execution checklist (lesson-writer). This ensures consistency across all future chapters targeting non-programmers.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- **Failure modes observed**:
  - Originally, lessons were too comprehensive (4 package managers, complex scenarios). This caused cognitive overload.
  - Fixing required removing content, not adding. Counter-intuitive but effective.

- **Graders run and results**:
  - ✅ Constitution: New principles are principle-structured (Why It Matters + What This Means)
  - ✅ CLAUDE.md: Beginner guidelines are practical with examples
  - ✅ lesson-writer: Checklist aligns with governance intentions

- **Prompt variant**: (N/A—this is institutional governance, not experimental)

- **Next experiment**:
  Apply these patterns to Chapter 8 (Git & GitHub) and measure:
  - Completion rate (do learners finish the chapter?)
  - Comprehension (can they explain concepts without syntax?)
  - Confidence (do they feel able to ask AI for help?)

## Key Insights Captured

### What We Learned
1. **Reduction > Addition**: For beginners, removing options is more effective than adding explanations
2. **Concept Anchors Matter**: Explaining WHAT before HOW dramatically reduces anxiety
3. **Error Literacy Empowers**: Students gain confidence when we teach them to distinguish signal from noise
4. **AI-as-Decision-Maker Works**: Students don't need to memorize if the agent chooses the tool; they learn concepts instead
5. **Business Context Sticks**: Framing around "shipping products" resonates more than "learning X"

### This Reflects Constitutional Principles
- ✅ Principle 1 (AI-First): AI handles complexity; students understand
- ✅ Principle 5 (Progressive Complexity): Beginner content deliberately simplified
- ✅ Principle 8 (Accessibility): New error literacy addition makes technical content accessible
- ✅ Principle 10 (Real-World): Practical scenarios focused on actual work, not theory
- ✅ Principle 12 (NEW): Cognitive load consciousness is now explicit
- ✅ Principle 13 (NEW): Concept-before-command is now explicit

### Model for Future Chapters
All chapters targeting non-programmers (business founders, complete beginners) should now:
1. Follow the cognitive load thresholds (max 2 options, max 5 concepts)
2. Use the Concept-First pattern (WHAT → WHY → HOW → PRACTICE)
3. Position AI as the tool-selector
4. Include Red Flags sections for technical lessons
5. Connect to business/product outcomes

  - Includes examples from Chapter 5 and implementation guidance
  - Practical thresholds (max 2 options, max 5 concepts, etc.)

### `.claude/agents/lesson-writer.md`
- **Added**: "Beginner Content Only" checklist — 12 items

## Governance Enforcement

**How these patterns will be enforced:**

1. **Constitution** → Used by chapter-planner to validate beginner chapter specs
2. **CLAUDE.md** → Referenced by lesson-writer during content creation
3. **lesson-writer checklist** → Automated check during content validation
4. **Technical-reviewer** → Will verify against these standards before publication

Pattern is now self-reinforcing: spec → plan → write → validate

- **Constitutional Alignment**: 100% (new principles added, existing ones extended)
- **Implementation Ready**: Yes—all guidelines are actionable with clear thresholds
