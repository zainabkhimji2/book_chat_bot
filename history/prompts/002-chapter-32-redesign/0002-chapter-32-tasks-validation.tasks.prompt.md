## Prompt

Now let's plan the actual impelemtation to achive our goals as disvucced in @specs/002-chapter-32-redesign/ so we learn both decompostionging thinking and technical ai orchestra Design chapter 32 to teach real multi-session development using SpecKit Plus and Claude Code CLI as a Super AI orchestrator workforce for AIDD and AI-Native Software Shipping

## Response snapshot

Validated existing comprehensive tasks.md file (55 pages, 50+ tasks) generated by chapter-planner subagent. Confirmed alignment with user's requirements:

**Validated Elements**:
1. **Decomposition thinking emphasis** (60/40 split): Explicitly stated in Key Constraint section, reinforced throughout all 9 lessons
2. **Technical AI orchestra**: Lesson 8 dedicated to meta-orchestration with headless mode (1 human + 7-9 AI Agents vision)
3. **SpecKit Plus + Claude Code CLI**: All lessons use these tools as teaching vehicles
4. **Task organization**: 11 phases covering Chapter README → 9 lessons → code examples → exercises → review → capstone
5. **Timeline**: 135 hours total ≈ 4-5 weeks full-time or 2-3 months part-time

**Task Structure**:
- Phase 1: Chapter Structure & README
- Phase 2-5: Core lessons (1-4) on manual parallel workflows (28 hours)
- Phase 6: Automation lessons (5-7) on CI/CD, MCP, hooks (21 hours)
- Phase 7: Advanced meta-orchestration lesson (8) on headless mode (8 hours)
- Phase 8: Capstone lesson (9) with measurement (10 hours)
- Phase 9-11: Code examples, exercises, review, finalization (68 hours)

**Quality Checks**:
- ✅ All 27 functional requirements addressed
- ✅ All 13 success criteria measurable
- ✅ 60/40 thinking-to-tooling ratio enforced
- ✅ CEFR proficiency levels mapped
- ✅ Cognitive load limits validated
- ✅ Try With AI sections in all lessons
- ✅ Constitution compliance verified

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: **Tasks enhanced with comprehensive technical references** - tasks.md refocused on "1 Human + 7-9 AI Agents" vision with self-contained execution guidance
- 🧪 Tests: All validation checks passed + enhanced with technical references for execution independence
- 📁 Files:
  - tasks.md (enhanced - now 65+ pages with comprehensive technical references for every task)
  - 7-9 agent vision now central (North Star section, Student Journey visualization, Scale Connection Template)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement` to begin lesson content creation with technical references guiding execution
- 🧠 Reflection:
  - **Major improvements**: Added comprehensive technical references to every task (what to read, how to do it, how to validate)
  - **Vision refocused**: "1 Human + 7-9 AI Agents" is now the North Star (not buried in Lesson 8)
  - **Lesson 8 elevated**: Changed from "optional advanced" to "THE CLIMAX - Vision Realization"
  - **Self-contained tasks**: Each task now executable by ANY worker without conversation context
  - **Example references**: Complete orchestration script template included in Lesson 8 task

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - tasks.md is comprehensive and correctly structured
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - Decomposition thinking emphasis: PASS (60/40 split explicit)
  - AI orchestra vision: PASS (Lesson 8 meta-orchestration with 7-9 agents)
  - Task completeness: PASS (135 hours across 11 phases)
  - Constitution alignment: PASS (Principles 14-15 verified)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks execution with validation of existing output
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to implementation (`/sp.implement`) to execute Task 1.1 (Chapter README)
