## Prompt

Now given these updates let's ensure our subagents and skills don't have any drifts @.claude

## Response snapshot

Executed comprehensive audit using Explore agent to review all subagents and skills in .claude/ directory.

**Audit Scope**: 18 files (4 subagents + 14 skills)

**Findings**:
- **CRITICAL Drifts** (2 files): 
  - ai-collaborate-teaching: "co-reasoning" terminology, missing Three Roles Framework
  - lesson-writer.md: v3.0.0 references, missing evals-first, missing co-learning convergence
  
- **HIGH Drifts** (7 files):
  - chapter-planner, technical-reviewer, book-scaffolding, content-evaluation-framework
  - quiz-generator, proof-validator, docusaurus-deployer
  - Missing: Nine Pillars validation, LLM→LAM context, co-learning validation
  
- **MEDIUM Drifts** (5 files):
  - code-example-generator, concept-scaffolding, assessment-builder
  - learning-objectives, exercise-designer
  - Missing: Evals-first pattern, CEFR integration, Three-Role context

**Overall**: 78% of files (14/18) had constitutional drifts

**Top 10 Issues**:
1. Version references outdated (v3.0.0/v3.0.1 → v3.1.2)
2. Co-learning bidirectional learning not demonstrated
3. "Specs Are the New Syntax" not emphasized as PRIMARY
4. Nine Pillars framework not referenced
5. AI-First closure policy not enforced
6. Evals-first pattern not prominent
7. LLM vs LAM distinction not addressed
8. Three Roles assessment missing
9. CEFR proficiency levels not integrated
10. Five Powers framework not referenced

**Deliverables Created**:
- AUDIT_EXECUTIVE_BRIEF.txt (11 KB) - For stakeholders
- AUDIT_SUMMARY.md (8 KB) - For implementation team
- AUDIT_REPORT_v3_1_2.md (38 KB) - Comprehensive file-by-file audit
- AUDIT_INDEX.md - Navigation guide

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete visibility into constitutional drift across all subagents/skills; clear 3-week remediation roadmap (40-45 hours)
- 🧪 Tests: Manual review of all 18 files against constitution v3.1.2
- 📁 Files: 4 audit documents created, 18 files analyzed
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implement all audit fixes (CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM priority)
- 🧠 Reflection: Systematic audit revealed widespread drift; detailed specifications enable efficient remediation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Constitutional updates (v3.0.0 → v3.1.2) not propagated to subagents/skills; terminology inconsistency across files
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): AUDIT COMPLETE - 14/18 files need updates (2 CRITICAL, 7 HIGH, 5 MEDIUM)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Used Explore agent with "thorough" search level
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Fix CRITICAL files first (ai-collaborate-teaching, lesson-writer) before proceeding to HIGH/MEDIUM
