## Response snapshot

**Comprehensive evaluation completed with 75-80% baseline alignment identified.**

**Key Findings:**

**Approved Updates (11 major changes):**
- A1: Added AI Development Spectrum (Assisted → Driven → Native) with visual model
- A2: Revised Co-Reasoning to Co-Learning with bidirectional learning emphasis
- A3: Added Principle 18 - The Three-Role AI Partnership (Teacher/Student/Co-Worker)
- A4: Added "From User Interface to User Intent" paradigm shift
- A5: Added "Why AI Makes Developers MORE Valuable" section
- B2: Added The Five Powers framework (See/Hear/Reason/Act/Remember)
- C2: Added "Why This Is the Best Time to Learn Software Development"
- D1: Added 99x Multiplier quantification to Principle 2
- E1: Reordered Core Philosophy (Spectrum → Co-Learning → Spec → Evals → Validation)
- E3: Terminology alignment (co-reasoning → co-learning throughout)
- F1: Enhanced Principle 13 with visual model and professional work mapping

**Rejected Updates (5 items):**
- B1: LAMs vs LLMs terminology (avoid technology-specific evolution)
- B3: AGI Roadmap positioning (avoid market timing)
- C1: Market context & timeline (keep timeless)
- D2: Founder business context (keep pedagogical focus)
- E2: "Why This Book Now" consolidated section

**Impact:**
- Constitution v3.0.2 → v3.1.0
- Added ~360 lines (+29% growth)
- Strengthened philosophical foundation
- Addressed replacement anxiety
- Quantified value proposition
- Enhanced visual models for teaching patterns

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution now strongly aligned (90%+) with AI Driven & AI Native Development presentation paradigm
- 🧪 Tests: All verifications passed (grep checks for each major addition)
- 📁 Files: Updated constitution.md with 11 approved changes
- 🔁 Next prompts: Apply constitution v3.1.0 to chapter content; update subagents to align with new Three Roles framework
- 🧠 Reflection: Strategic decision to keep constitution timeless (rejecting market timing/business strategy) while adding core philosophical frameworks (co-learning, three roles, spectrum) strengthens long-term value

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - systematic evaluation and approval process prevented issues
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - User approved all updates before application
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard constitution evaluation workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Test new Core Philosophy ordering (Spectrum-first) with chapter-planner subagent to ensure proper context application
