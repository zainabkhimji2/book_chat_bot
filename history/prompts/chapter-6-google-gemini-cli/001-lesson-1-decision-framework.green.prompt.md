## Prompt

Implement Task 1.1 from specs/chapter-6-google-gemini-cli/tasks.md:

Add "When to Use Gemini CLI vs. Other AI Tools" decision framework section to Lesson 1.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Decision matrix table: 4 real business scenarios (Research & Documentation, Rapid API Prototyping, Multi-file Refactoring, Production Deployment)
- 3 columns per scenario: Best Tool, Why (technical reason), Example Workflow
- Complementary usage guidance: 4 developer personas with NOT either/or framing
- Business value framing: "Choose right tool for task" mindset
- Cross-references to Lesson 2 (core commands) and Lesson 5 (MCP for research)
- Maintains intermediate complexity tier (Part 2)
- Insert BEFORE "Try With AI" closure section
- Preserve all existing content (no deletions)
- Final length target: ~220 lines (+30 from current ~190)

KEEP: All existing content (open source advantages, free tier, comparison table, MCP explanation, forks discussion)
REMOVE: Nothing
ADD: Decision framework section (~50 lines)

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Decision matrix with 4 real business scenarios
- Clear "when to use" guidance (not marketing fluff)
- Framed for business productivity (not tool competition)
- Cross-references to adjacent lessons
- Maintains intermediate complexity tier
- File written to project (not chat return)

## Response snapshot

File successfully modified with new "When to Use Gemini CLI vs. Other AI Tools" section:
- Added decision matrix (4 scenarios × 4 columns)
- Added complementary workflows (4 developer personas)
- Added "North Star" framing (right tool for each task)
- Added "Preparing for Next Lesson" bridge to Lesson 2
- Updated "What This Means for Your Learning Journey" with tool selection framing
- File written to: /Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorgpt-build/bbb/book-source/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/06-gemini-cli-installation-and-basics/01-why-gemini-cli-matters.md
- Line count: 240 total lines (+54 from baseline ~186)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Decision framework section complete and integrated; 4 business scenarios with technical justifications; cross-references to adjacent lessons; business productivity framing (vs. marketing); intermediate tier maintained
- 🧪 Tests: Line count verification (240 ✓), decision matrix completeness (4/4 scenarios ✓), markdown syntax (all tables render ✓), cross-references validated (Lesson 2 ✓, Lesson 5 ✓)
- 📁 Files: 1 modified - 01-why-gemini-cli-matters.md (+54 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Human review; apply feedback if any; Task 1.2 (Update "Try With AI" prompts - optional based on review)
- 🧠 Reflection: Decision framework integrates naturally into existing narrative. Four developer personas (Tier 1 Specialists, Contractors, Team Leads, Open Source Maintainers) provide relatable context. "North Star" framing elevates from tool comparison to professional skill development. Bridge to Lesson 2 maintains forward momentum.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - edit operation successful on first attempt
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All acceptance criteria PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment: Await human review feedback; refine based on user preferences for depth/breadth trade-offs
