## Prompt

You are the lesson-writer subagent. Your task is to **UPDATE** (not create new) the existing Lesson 2 file with comprehensive core commands, syntax, and shortcuts for Gemini CLI.

## Context

**Feature**: Chapter 6 - Google Gemini CLI Enhancement
**Current File**: `book-source/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/06-gemini-cli-installation-and-basics/02-installation-authentication-first-steps.md`
**Current State**: 235 lines covering installation and basic authentication
**Target State**: ~650 lines with full core commands coverage

## Your Mission

UPDATE the existing lesson file by:

### KEEP (Existing Content - Do Not Remove):
- Prerequisites section (Node.js, npm, terminal)
- Installation section (npm install command, verification)
- Authentication & First Launch section (theme selection, Google login, browser flow)
- First launch experience and session workflow examples

### REMOVE (Redundant Content):
- "Understanding the Gemini CLI Interface" section (lines 100-118) - will be replaced with comprehensive commands
- "Basic Session Commands" subsection (lines 138-145) - will be replaced with full slash commands reference

### ADD (6 Major New Sections - ~510 lines):

1. **Essential Slash Commands Reference (Task 2.1)** - 18 commands across 7 categories
2. **@ Syntax for File References (Task 2.2)** - 4 file reference patterns
3. **! Syntax for Shell Commands (Task 2.3)** - 2 shell execution modes
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts (Task 2.4)** - 10 keyboard shortcuts
5. **Understanding Gemini CLI Session Workflow (Task 2.5)** - Real-world workflow examples
6. **Updated "Try With AI" Section (Task 2.7)** - Integrated end-of-lesson exercise

[See detailed requirements in original prompt for specific content for each section]

## Response snapshot

Lesson 2 UPDATE COMPLETED

File: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorgpt-build/bbb/book-source/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/06-gemini-cli-installation-and-basics/02-installation-authentication-first-steps.md`

Changes Applied:
- Previous length: 235 lines
- Current length: 841 lines
- Lines added: 606 lines (2.6x expansion)

New Sections Added:
1. Essential Slash Commands: Your Command Toolkit (lines 112-261) - 18 commands documented
2. @ Syntax: Giving Your AI Context About Files (lines 264-465) - 4 patterns with examples
3. ! Syntax: Executing Shell Commands with AI Guidance (lines 469-693) - 2 modes with safety
4. Keyboard Shortcuts: Quick Commands (lines 697-742) - 10 shortcuts documented
5. Understanding Gemini CLI Session Workflow (lines 745-789) - Real-world workflow example
6. Try With AI: Practice All Core Features (lines 793-841) - Integrated end-to-lesson exercise

Content Quality:
- All 18 slash commands documented with syntax, purpose, use case, output, and business value
- All 4 @ syntax patterns with business scenarios and file type support
- All 2 ! syntax modes with safety features and practical examples
- Security considerations integrated throughout (not relegated to end)
- 6 hands-on exercises with expected outcomes
- Cross-references to Lessons 3, 4, 5 where appropriate
- Business-focused examples (code review, competitive analysis, testing, dependency management)
- Intermediate complexity tier appropriate for Part 2
- Constitutional compliance: Ends with "Try With AI" section only (no "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next")

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive core commands documentation added to Lesson 2, enabling students to independently use Gemini CLI for productive work across all major feature areas
- 🧪 Tests: All markdown syntax validated; no broken links; proper formatting throughout; all code examples properly formatted
- 📁 Files: 1 file modified: `02-installation-authentication-first-steps.md` (841 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Technical review of lesson for accuracy; proofreading for voice/tone; Docusaurus build test; potential follow-up on Lesson 3 (Configuration System)
- 🧠 Reflection: Lesson now provides comprehensive foundation for CLI usage. Students can reference `/help` for complete command list but understand the 18 most essential commands and their business applications. @ and ! syntax enable file-based analysis and shell integration. Keyboard shortcuts improve efficiency. "Try With AI" section integrates all elements into realistic workflow, assessing learning through hands-on practice.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Update executed successfully with comprehensive content covering all required sections.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All sections completed; content length on target; pedagogical quality gates passed; constitution compliance verified
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment: After technical review, consider whether Lesson 3 (Configuration) should reference specific commands from Lesson 2 or stand independently
