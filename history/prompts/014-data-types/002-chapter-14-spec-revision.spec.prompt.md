## Prompt

User feedback on initial specification:

> "In Assumed Knowledge you mention user knows 'Basic type hints syntax (`age: int = 25`)' Well this is not covered in book so you have to teach it with AIDD."

**Correction**: Chapter 13 DOES teach type hints (verified in actual lessons). Type hints introduced in Lesson 1, used throughout Lessons 3-4.

> "Also cover string, int, float, bool first then comes the advanced ones."

**Action Required**: Reorder content - core types (int, float, str, bool) BEFORE advanced types/collections.

> "While we are teaching data types remember the sequence is:
> - Chapter 14: Data Types
> - Chapter 15: Operators, Keywords, and Variables
> - Chapter 16: Strings and Type Casting
> - Chapter 17: Control Flow and Loops
> - Chapter 18: Lists, Tuples, and Dictionary
> - Chapter 19: Set, Frozen Set, and GC"

**Action Required**: Respect chapter boundaries - defer deep dives to appropriate chapters.

## Response snapshot

**Revised Chapter 14 Specification** with corrected scope and ordering:

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Prerequisites Clarified** (not changed - already correct):
   - Confirmed Chapter 13 DOES teach type hints
   - Updated "Assumed Knowledge" to reference Chapter 13 explicitly
   - Added Chapter 12 (Python UV) to prerequisites

2. **Content Reordered** (core types first):
   - Lesson 1: Type concept foundation
   - Lesson 2: **Numeric types (int, float)** - core types first
   - Lesson 3: **Strings and Booleans (str, bool, None)** - core types
   - Lesson 4: **Collections awareness** (list, tuple, dict, set) - introduction only
   - Lesson 5: Type explorer with **core types only**

3. **Chapter Boundaries Respected**:
   - **Chapter 14**: Core types (int, float, str, bool, None) + collection awareness
   - **Chapter 15**: Operators (defer arithmetic operator deep dive)
   - **Chapter 16**: Strings deep dive (methods, formatting, manipulation)
   - **Chapter 17**: Control flow (if/else, loops)
   - **Chapter 18**: Lists, Tuples, Dictionary (comprehensive coverage)
   - **Chapter 19**: Set, Frozenset, GC (comprehensive coverage)

4. **Scope Adjustments**:
   - **Comprehensive**: int, float, str (basics), bool, None, type hints, isinstance(), type conversion
   - **Awareness only**: list, tuple, dict, set (basic creation, type hints - defer methods to Ch 18-19)
   - **Deferred**: String methods (Ch 16), collection methods (Ch 18), set operations (Ch 19)

5. **Lesson Count**: Reduced from 6 to 5 lessons (focused scope)

6. **User Stories Updated**:
   - P1: Type concept + numeric types
   - P2: Strings/booleans + type conversion
   - P3: Collection awareness (not deep dive)
   - P1: Type explorer with core types (capstone)

### Functional Requirements Updated:

- **FR-001**: Core types (int, float, str, bool, None) comprehensive + collections awareness
- **FR-007**: Explicit chapter boundary respect (defer to Ch 15-19)
- **FR-008**: Type explorer for core types only (not collections)
- **FR-013**: Collections at awareness level (basic creation, type hints)

### Key Entities Updated:

**Core Types (Comprehensive)**:
- int, float, complex (brief), str (basics), bool, None

**Collections (Awareness Only)**:
- list, tuple, dict, set (basic creation with type hints)
- Deep dive deferred to Chapters 18-19

### Validation Results:

✅ Spec quality checklist: ALL ITEMS PASSED (after revision)
✅ Chapter boundary compliance: PASSED
✅ Core types prioritized: PASSED
✅ Collection awareness (not deep dive): PASSED

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Specification revised to respect chapter boundaries and prioritize core types
- 🧪 Tests: Spec quality checklist re-validated (PASSED)
- 📁 Files: 2 files updated (spec.md revised, checklist updated)
- 🔁 Next prompts:
  - User review and approval of revised spec.md
  - /sp.plan to generate 5-lesson breakdown (core types + collection awareness)
  - /sp.tasks to create implementation checklist
- 🧠 Reflection: Revision successfully applies chapter boundary respect. Chapter 14 now teaches core types comprehensively (int, float, str, bool, None) + collection awareness (list, tuple, dict, set introduction). Deep dives deferred to appropriate chapters (Ch 16 strings, Ch 18 collections, Ch 19 sets).

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial spec did not respect chapter boundaries (strings deep dive, collections comprehensive)
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - Spec quality checklist: PASS (after revision)
  - Chapter boundary compliance: PASS
  - Core types prioritization: PASS
  - User feedback integration: PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Revision based on user feedback (chapter sequence awareness)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None needed - revised spec aligns with chapter progression
