## Prompt

Write Chapter 14: Data Types in Part 4

## AIDD-First Python Teaching Context

**WHO WE'RE TEACHING**:
- Universal audience (beginners AND professionals transitioning to Python)
- New learning approach: AIDD-first (not traditional syntax memorization)
- Students completed Chapters 1-13: AIDD principles + first Python program

**WHAT THIS CHAPTER TEACHES**:
- Comprehensive Python data types (all types: numeric, boolean, sequence, mapping, set, binary)
- Focus: Understanding types through AI partnership, NOT memorizing syntax
- Scope: Chapter 14 "Data Types" ONLY - no forward references to later chapters

**WHAT STUDENTS BUILD**:
- Interactive type explorer with AI
- Program where students experiment with types and learn through AI dialogue
- Understand "what can I do with this type?" by asking AI, not memorizing

**AIDD PRINCIPLES TO REINFORCE**:
1. **AI Partnership for Type Exploration**: Students use Claude Code/Gemini CLI to understand types through dialogue
2. **Troubleshooting with AI** (Rule 6 pattern): When TypeError occurs, ask AI "why did this fail?" instead of Googling

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Chapter 14: Data Types following AIDD-first Python teaching methodology.

**Specification Highlights**:

1. **Success Evals (Business-Goal-Aligned)**:
   - 75%+ can explain type concept in own words
   - 80%+ can use isinstance() for validation
   - 90%+ can explore types through AI dialogue
   - 85%+ can troubleshoot TypeError with AI
   - 100% build working interactive type explorer

2. **User Stories (Prioritized P1-P3)**:
   - P1: Type concept foundation, numeric/boolean exploration
   - P2: Sequences, mapping/sets, type conversion
   - P3: Interactive type explorer capstone

3. **Content Outline (6 Lessons)**:
   - Lesson 1: Understanding Data Types (foundation)
   - Lesson 2: Numeric and Boolean Types
   - Lesson 3: Sequence Types (str, list, tuple, range)
   - Lesson 4: Mapping and Set Types (dict, set, frozenset)
   - Lesson 5: Binary Types and Type Conversion
   - Lesson 6: Interactive Type Explorer (capstone)

4. **AIDD Teaching Pattern Applied**:
   - Every lesson: Concept → Code → Try With AI → Reasoning
   - Standardized "Try With AI" format (4 prompts per lesson)
   - Troubleshooting with AI pattern integrated
   - AI partnership emphasized throughout

5. **Ruthless Context Filtering**:
   - Extracted: All Python built-in types from context materials
   - Skipped: Integer interning, memory internals (Ch 29), file handling (Ch 22), UTF-8 details (Ch 16)
   - Zero forward references to Chapters 15-29

6. **Compliance**:
   - Python 3.14+ standards (type hints, modern syntax)
   - Cognitive load limits (max 7-8 concepts/lesson)
   - Complexity tier A2-B1 (intermediate beginners)
   - All critical design rules applied (Rules 1-7)

**Validation Results**:
- ✅ Spec quality checklist: ALL ITEMS PASSED
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- ✅ All requirements testable and unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria measurable and technology-agnostic
- ✅ Ready for planning phase

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete Chapter 14 specification created with comprehensive AIDD-first Python teaching approach
- 🧪 Tests: Spec quality checklist validation passed (all items satisfied)
- 📁 Files: 2 files created (spec.md, checklists/requirements.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts:
  - User review and approval of spec.md
  - /sp.plan to generate lesson-by-lesson breakdown with CEFR proficiency levels
  - /sp.tasks to create implementation checklist
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully applies AIDD-first methodology to comprehensive Python data types coverage. Ruthless filtering ensured Chapter 14 scope maintained without forward references. Teaching pattern standardized across all 6 lessons.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - spec completed successfully on first iteration
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - Spec quality checklist: PASS (all 14 items satisfied)
  - Content quality: PASS (no implementation details, user-focused, stakeholder-readable)
  - Requirement completeness: PASS (testable, measurable, bounded)
  - Feature readiness: PASS (acceptance criteria clear, scenarios defined)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None - standard /sp.specify workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None needed - spec ready for planning phase
