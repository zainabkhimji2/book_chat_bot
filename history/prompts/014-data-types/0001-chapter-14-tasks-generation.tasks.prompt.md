## Prompt

User ran `/sp.tasks 014-data-types` command to generate task breakdown for Chapter 14: Data Types implementation.

**Command Context**:
- Feature: Chapter 14 - Data Types (Part 4: Python Fundamentals)
- Input documents: spec.md (5 user stories), plan.md (5 lessons with CEFR proficiency levels)
- Target: Educational content (book chapter), not software development
- Organization: Tasks by lesson (not traditional development user stories)

**Key Requirements**:
- 58 tasks organized across 8 phases
- Educational content structure (lessons, not code features)
- All lessons must end with "Try With AI" section only
- Python 3.14+ code examples with type hints
- AI-Native Learning pattern throughout
- No forward references to Chapters 15-29

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive tasks.md with 58 tasks organized into 8 phases:

**Phase 1: Setup** (3 tasks)
- Create chapter directory structure
- Initialize chapter readme.md
- Verify Python 3.14+ environment

**Phase 2-6: Lessons 1-5** (40 tasks total)
- Lesson 1: Variables and Type Hints (7 tasks) - User Story 1
- Lesson 2: Integers and Floats (8 tasks) - User Story 2
- Lesson 3: Strings and Booleans (8 tasks) - User Story 3
- Lesson 4: Collections Awareness (9 tasks) - User Story 4
- Lesson 5: Type Explorer Capstone (8 tasks) - User Story 5

**Phase 7: Integration & QA** (9 tasks)
- Validate code examples, type checking, chapter progression
- Verify AI-Native Learning pattern, no forward references
- Check lesson closure compliance ("Try With AI" only)

**Phase 8: Polish & Documentation** (6 tasks)
- Frontmatter, Docusaurus build, navigation links

**Key Adaptations for Educational Content**:
1. **Organization**: By lesson (not user story) - lessons are deliverables
2. **No tests**: Educational content doesn't need unit/integration tests
3. **Lesson structure requirements**: Must end with "Try With AI" only
4. **Code validation**: All Python examples must work in 3.14+
5. **Parallel opportunities**: Lessons 1-4 can be written concurrently (different files)

**User Story → Lesson Mapping**:
- US1 (Variables - P1) → Lesson 1
- US2 (Data Types - P1) → Lesson 2
- US3 (Strings/Booleans - P2) → Lesson 3
- US4 (Collections Awareness - P3) → Lesson 4
- US5 (Type Explorer - P1) → Lesson 5

**Dependencies**:
- Lessons 1-4: Can write in parallel (different files)
- Lesson 5: Sequential (integrates all prior lessons)
- MVP: Lessons 1-2 only (15 tasks)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Chapter 14 tasks.md created with 58 actionable tasks organized by lesson
- 🧪 Tests: All task format validated (checkbox, ID, lesson label, file paths)
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (tasks.md in specs/part-4-chapter-14/)
- 🔁 Next prompts:
  - Begin lesson implementation using lesson-writer subagent (or manual)
  - Start with MVP (Lessons 1-2) for early validation
  - After all lessons: Run technical-reviewer for validation
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks successfully adapted for educational content (lessons vs code features). Key insight: Educational content allows parallel lesson writing (different files), but capstone lesson (L5) must integrate all prior content sequentially. Task structure enforces critical lesson closure requirement ("Try With AI" only).

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - template adapted correctly for educational content context
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - Task format compliance: PASS (all tasks follow [ID] [P?] [Lesson] format)
  - User story mapping: PASS (5 stories → 5 lessons clear)
  - Dependencies documented: PASS (phase dependencies + lesson dependencies explicit)
  - Parallel opportunities: PASS (Lessons 1-4 parallel, L5 sequential)
  - Critical requirements captured: PASS (lesson closure, AI-Native Learning, no forward refs)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks adapted for educational content (lessons not features)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None needed - structure appropriate for book chapter implementation
