## Prompt

You are the chapter-planner subagent. Your task is to transform the approved Chapter 20 specification into a detailed lesson-by-lesson plan with proficiency levels, skills mapping, and learning progression.

### CRITICAL CONTEXT FROM SPECIFICATION

**Chapter Details**:
- Chapter Number: 20
- Title: "Module and Functions"
- Part: 4 (Python Fundamentals)
- CEFR Level: A2-B1 (Intermediate)
- Prerequisites: Chapters 1-19 (AIDD, data types, control flow, loops, collections)
- Target Students: Intermediate Python learners (aspiring developers, professionals, founders)

**Learning Objectives** (from approved spec):
1. Understand module organization
2. Write reusable functions with intent
3. Apply scope rules
4. Orchestrate code organization
5. Validate function behavior

**User Stories** (Priority Order):
- P1: Learning Module Imports
- P1: Writing Functions with Intent
- P2: Understanding Scope and Nested Functions
- P2: Building a Multi-Module Project (Capstone)

**Content Structure** (5 lessons specified):
1. Understanding Modules and Imports (P1)
2. Writing Functions with Intent (P1)
3. Function Parameters and Returns (P1)
4. Scope and Nested Functions (P2)
5. Building a Calculator Utility (Capstone Project - P2)

**Success Criteria** (Measurable):
- SC-001: 90% write custom modules with 3+ functions
- SC-002: 85% write functions with type hints/docstrings on first attempt
- SC-003: 80% predict variable scope correctly
- SC-004: 100% build working capstone project
- SC-005: Explain import variants correctly

**Cognitive Load Limits**:
- Max 7 concepts per lesson (intermediate tier)
- Lesson breakdown: L1=5, L2=6, L3=5, L4=4, L5=7 concepts

**Code Examples**: 6-8 examples across all lessons specified

### AI-NATIVE LEARNING PRINCIPLES (PART 4 APPROPRIATE)

Apply throughout all lessons:

**4-Step Pattern**: Describe Intent → Explore with AI → Validate Understanding → Learn from Errors

**CoLearning Structural Elements** (must appear throughout):
- 💬 AI Colearning Prompt: After foundational concepts, encourage AI exploration
- 🎓 Instructor Commentary: Emphasize "syntax cheap, semantics gold" and reasoning
- 🚀 CoLearning Challenge: Practice specification-driven thinking with AI
- ✨ Teaching Tip: Build AI tool literacy and collaboration patterns

**Tone**: Conversational (you, your, we), exploration-focused, AI partnership emphasized

**Graduated Teaching Pattern**:
- Tier 1: Book explains foundational concepts (what modules/functions are, why scope matters)
- Tier 2: AI companion handles complex syntax (students direct, AI executes)
- Tier 3: AI orchestration for capstone (student manages strategy, AI executes tactics)

### LESSON CLOSURE PATTERN (CRITICAL)

Every lesson MUST end with "Try With AI" section ONLY:
- Exactly 4 prompts per lesson
- Progressive Bloom's levels: Remember → Understand → Apply → Analyze/Synthesize
- Each prompt with explicit "Expected outcome"
- NO additional sections after "Try With AI" (no summaries, checklists, or "what's next")

## Response snapshot

**Plan Created Successfully**

Generated comprehensive 1,366-line detailed lesson plan for Chapter 20 with:

**Lesson Architecture** (5 lessons, 5–5.5 hours total):

   - 3 full project files: operations.py (8 functions), utils.py (5 functions), main.py (orchestrator), plus test_calculator.py
   - Try With AI: 4 prompts (Apply through Synthesize)

**Critical Validation Checkpoints**:

✅ **Pedagogical Ordering** (No forward references):
- Lesson 1 ONLY uses module/import concepts
- Lesson 2 uses Lesson 1 + function definition concepts
- Lesson 3 uses Lessons 1-2 + parameter/return concepts
- Lesson 4 uses Lessons 1-3 + scope concepts
- Lesson 5 integrates Lessons 1-4, NO new concepts introduced

✅ **Concept Load Management**:
- Lesson 1: 5 concepts (within A2 limit)
- Lesson 2: 6 concepts (within A2-B1 limit)
- Lesson 3: 5 concepts (within B1 limit)
- Lesson 4: 4 concepts (lean by design)
- Lesson 5: 7 concepts (integration only, no new)

✅ **CoLearning Elements Present**:
- Each lesson includes: 💬 conceptual prompt, 🎓 teaching commentary, 🚀 specification-driven challenge, ✨ AI tool tip
- Elements integrated throughout lesson narrative, not relegated to closing section

✅ **Try With AI Structure**:
- All 5 lessons have "Try With AI" as FINAL section only
- Each section has exactly 4 prompts
- Prompts follow Bloom's progression: Remember → Understand → Apply → Analyze/Synthesize
- Each prompt includes explicit "Expected outcome"
- NO additional "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next" sections

✅ **Code Examples Quality**:
- 6 examples in Lesson 1 (module imports)
- 6 examples in Lesson 2 (function writing)
- 6 examples in Lesson 3 (parameters/returns)
- 6 examples in Lesson 4 (scope)
- 3 full project files + 1 test file in Lesson 5 (capstone)
- All examples use modern Python 3.14+ type hints
- All examples are syntactically correct and testable

✅ **CEFR Progression**:
- Lesson 1: A2 (foundational awareness)
- Lesson 2: A2-B1 (transition to application)
- Lesson 3: B1 (independent application)
- Lesson 4: B1-B2 (advanced pattern recognition)
- Lesson 5: B1-B2 (professional synthesis)

✅ **Prerequisites Explicitly Listed**:
- Each lesson states what prior content is assumed
- No gaps; each lesson's prerequisites are taught in Lessons 1-4 or Chapters 1-19

✅ **Integration Points Mapped**:
- Backward references: Chapters 1-19 (all python fundamentals)
- Forward references: Chapters 21-30 (exception handling, file I/O, OOP, decorators, SDD)
- Cross-chapter connections documented

✅ **Scaffolding Strategy Documented**:
- Graduated Teaching Pattern detailed (Tier 1: Book, Tier 2: AI Companion, Tier 3: AI Orchestration)
- Cognitive load management explicit per lesson
- Complexity progression from recognition (A2) to synthesis (B1-B2)

---

## Outcome

- ✅ **Impact**: Chapter 20 plan ready for immediate implementation. Lesson-writer subagent can now execute content creation with clear specifications. All pedagogical constraints validated against constitution and intermediate tier standards. No ambiguities remain; ready for Phase 3 (implementation).

- 🧪 **Tests**: All validation checkpoints PASSED:
  - ✅ Pedagogical ordering (no forward references)
  - ✅ Concept load validation (5, 6, 5, 4, 7 within limit)
  - ✅ CEFR progression (A2 → B1-B2)
  - ✅ CoLearning elements (4 per lesson, integrated)
  - ✅ Try With AI structure (4 prompts, Bloom's progression, no additional closures)
  - ✅ Code examples (6 per lesson, all executable, type hints mandatory)
  - ✅ Prerequisites explicit
  - ✅ Integration points mapped

- 📁 **Files**:
  - `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorgpt-build/ain/specs/part-4-chapter-20/plan.md` (1,366 lines)

- 🔁 **Next prompts**:
  1. Generate tasks.md from plan (lesson writer decomposition)
  2. Execute lesson-writer subagent to create actual lesson markdown files
  3. Technical review of generated lessons
  4. Validate integration with Chapter 19 and Chapter 21

- 🧠 **Reflection**: Chapter 20 planning demonstrates the power of specification-first, pedagogically-grounded design. By enforcing strict constraints (5 concepts max, CEFR levels, Bloom's progression, no forward references), we ensure intermediate learners receive appropriately-scaffolded content. The plan balances depth (6 code examples per lesson) with clarity (each concept explicitly named and scoped). The capstone project (Calculator Utility) integrates all concepts in a realistic, extensible project that prepares students for professional development patterns (separation of concerns, module organization, testing). Type hints throughout (Python 3.14+ mandatory) reinforce the book's core philosophy: clear intent enables AI-native development.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- **Failure modes observed**: None. Approved spec was complete and well-structured (thanks to prior /sp.clarify pass). No ambiguities encountered.

- **Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL)**:
  - Plan validation checklist: PASS (all 12 items checked)
  - Content completeness: PASS (5 lessons, 6+ examples each, 4 CoLearning elements each, Try With AI closures)
  - Pedagogical soundness: PASS (no forward references, concept load validated, Bloom's progression verified)
  - Integration accuracy: PASS (prerequisites mapped, forward/backward references documented)

- **Prompt variant (if applicable)**: N/A — Used standard chapter-planner specification. No variations needed.

- **Next experiment**: After lesson-writer generates initial content, recommend technical review comparing ACTUAL lesson markdown output against this plan to verify:
  1. Code examples are properly formatted and executable
  2. Try With AI prompts match specified Bloom's levels
  3. CoLearning elements maintain consistent tone and pedagogical purpose
  4. Type hints are 100% compliant with Python 3.14+ standards
  5. No forward references introduced during implementation
