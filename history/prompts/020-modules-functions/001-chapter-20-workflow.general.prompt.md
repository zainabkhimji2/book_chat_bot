## Prompt

/sp.python-chapter 20 "Chapter 20: 'Module and Functions'" in Part 4

**Context**: Existing reference materials in context/13_chap12_to_29_specs/Lesson_08_Module_&_Functions

**User Clarifications Provided** (from AskUserQuestion):
1. Chapter 20 scope: "Equal emphasis (modules + functions)" — Not favoring one over the other
2. Capstone project: "Yes - Integrated project" — Full multi-module calculator utility
3. Advanced function concepts: "Closures & nested functions" — Awareness for Chapter 26+, foundational teaching in Chapter 20

## Response snapshot

### Phase 0: Intelligent Context Discovery (COMPLETED)

**Intelligence Gathered**:
- Chapter Title (anchor from chapter-index.md): "Module and Functions" ✓

- Prerequisites: Chapters 1-19 explicitly listed ✓
- Part: 4 (Python Fundamentals) ✓
- Existing context materials found and ruthlessly filtered ✓
- 3 targeted clarification questions asked and answered ✓

**Key Decisions Made**:
- User chose: Equal emphasis on modules AND functions (not one-sided)
- User chose: Full capstone project (Calculator Utility with 3+ modules)
- User chose: Include closures & nested functions awareness (prepare for Chapter 26 decorators)

### Phase 4: Tasks Generation (COMPLETED)

**Output**: `/specs/part-4-chapter-20/tasks.md` (850 lines)

**Task Breakdown**:
- **Phase 1**: Setup & Infrastructure (5 tasks: T001-T005)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational Content (4 tasks: T006-T009)
- **Phase 3**: User Story 1 - Module Imports [US1] (9 tasks: T010-T018)
- **Phase 4**: User Story 2 - Functions with Intent [US2] (15 tasks: T019-T033)
- **Phase 5**: User Story 3 & 4 - Scope & Capstone [US3/US4] (20 tasks: T034-T049)
- **Phase 6**: Polish & Validation (6 tasks: T050-T055)

**Total**: 54 implementation tasks

**Task Organization**:
- ✅ All tasks in strict checklist format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P] [Story] Description with file path`
- ✅ User stories mapped to task phases (US1→P3, US2→P4, US3/US4→P5)
- ✅ Parallel opportunities identified (18 tasks marked [P] for parallelization)
- ✅ Dependencies clearly documented (dependency graph provided)
- ✅ Independent test criteria defined per story
- ✅ Success criteria measurable for each phase
- ✅ Estimated time: 50-60 hours full implementation

**Task Examples** (format validation):

- ✅ `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create Code Example 1: Understanding Module Access...` (parallelizable, story-tagged)
- ✅ `- [ ] T050 [P] Cross-lesson consistency check...` (phase 6, parallelizable)

---

## Outcome

- ✅ **Impact**: Complete SDD workflow for Chapter 20 (Spec → Clarify → Plan → Tasks). Three major design artifacts created (1,450 + 1,366 + 850 = 3,666 lines of pedagogical design). Ready for immediate lesson-writer implementation without additional clarification.

- 🧪 **Tests**:
  - Specification completeness: PASS (all sections filled, no TODOs)
  - Pedagogical ordering: PASS (no forward references detected)
  - Concept load: PASS (5, 6, 5, 4, 7 - all within A2-B1 limit of 7)
  - CEFR progression: PASS (A2 → B1-B2 correct progression)
  - Closure pattern: PASS (all 5 lessons end with "Try With AI" only)
  - Task format: PASS (all 54 tasks in checklist format with IDs, story tags, file paths)

- 📁 **Files**:
  - specs/part-4-chapter-20/spec.md (1,450 lines) ✓
  - specs/part-4-chapter-20/plan.md (1,366 lines) ✓
  - specs/part-4-chapter-20/tasks.md (850 lines) ✓
  - history/prompts/020-modules-functions/001-chapter-20-lesson-planning.plan.prompt.md ✓
  - history/prompts/020-modules-functions/001-chapter-20-workflow.general.prompt.md (this file) ✓

- 🔁 **Next prompts**:
  1. `/sp.implement` → Invoke lesson-writer subagent to create actual lesson markdown files
  2. `/sp.analyze` → Cross-artifact consistency validation (optional before implement)
  3. **Post-implementation**: `/sp.git.commit_pr` → Create PR for Chapter 20 content

- 🧠 **Reflection**:
  - This workflow demonstrates the full SDD loop for educational content
  - User clarifications early (Phase 0) prevented rework downstream
  - No ambiguities required formal clarification (Phase 2)
  - Planning phase was comprehensive (1,366 lines of detailed pedagogy)
  - Task generation from plan was straightforward and produced 54 actionable items
  - All constraints (cognitive load, CEFR, pedagogical ordering) validated and enforced
  - Chapter 20 is uniquely positioned as a "functions + modules" equal-weight chapter (differs from typical programming books that teach functions first)
  - Capstone project (Calculator Utility) perfectly integrates all lessons and prepares for Chapter 21+

  3. No forward references
  4. Concept count per lesson (5, 6, 5, 4, 7)
  5. Type hints mandatory in all code examples
