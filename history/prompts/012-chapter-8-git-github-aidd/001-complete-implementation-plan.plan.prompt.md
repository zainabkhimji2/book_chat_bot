## Summary

Generated comprehensive implementation plan and task checklist for Chapter 8: Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development. Chapter targets complete beginners (Tier 1) in Part 2 of the book, following Chapters 5-7 (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Bash Essentials).

---

## Context

### Input Specification
- **Spec File**: `specs/012-chapter-8-git-github-aidd/spec.md` (approved, comprehensive 370+ line specification)
- **Chapter Type**: Technical/Hybrid (core concepts + hands-on conversational AIDD approach)
- **Target Audience**: Complete beginners with no prior Git/version control experience
- **Complexity Tier**: Tier 1 (max 2 options, max 5 concepts per lesson)
- **Estimated Duration**: 3.5-4 hours (200 minutes)
- **Key Constraint**: Two-part structure: Part I (Git concepts - 100 min) + Part II (AI prompts - 100 min)

### Key Requirements from Spec
1. Two-part structure enforced (Part I: Lessons 1-4; Part II: Lessons 5-8; Capstone: Lesson 9)
2. AIDD conversational teaching approach (students use natural language to AI for Git operations)
3. Comprehensive platform-specific installation (Windows, Mac, Linux)
4. Safety-first emphasis (version control as safety net for AI assistance)
5. Tier 1 cognitive load limits (max 2 options per decision, max 5 concepts per section)
6. Natural language prompt templates for all Git operations

### Reference Materials Consulted
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (v3.0.1): Project vision, 8 core philosophies, domain skills, non-negotiable rules, infrastructure
- `specs/book/chapter-index.md`: Chapter index showing 56-chapter structure, current status (Chapter 8 status: "Implemented" but planning phase)
- `.claude/output-styles/chapters.md`: Chapter output style guide, directory structure rules, naming conventions, YAML frontmatter
- Chapter spec file: Detailed requirements, user stories, edge cases, success criteria

---

## Planning Process

### Phase 1: Chapter Type Identification & Factual Foundation

**Determined chapter archetype**: Technical/Hybrid
- Primary: Core Git concepts and commands (technical)
- Secondary: Conversational AIDD prompts (hybrid, teaching how to ask AI)
- Not purely conceptual (has hands-on exercises)
- File naming: Descriptive lesson titles (not generic "lesson-1") because technical chapters benefit from descriptive names for discoverability

**Identified factual claims requiring verification**:
- Git installation links (git-scm.com, github.com) - must be current
- GitHub UI screenshots - may become outdated (maintenance trigger: annual review or major UI redesign)
- Git command syntax - tested on Git 2.40+
- Platform-specific instructions - tested on Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, recent Linux distributions
- IDE installation links - tested and current
- Python compatibility - examples use Python 3.13+

**Field volatility identified**:
- GitHub UI changes 2-3x/year (screenshots need maintenance)
- VS Code updates monthly (extension compatibility may break)
- Git versions stable but new flags added over time
- Python versions (3.13 in use; 3.14 expected Oct 2025)

**AI tool onboarding status**: Part 2 (post-tool introduction)
- Chapters 5-6 teach Claude Code and Gemini CLI
- Chapter 8 uses these as primary interface for Git operations
- "Try With AI" sections use learner's preferred AI companion (not ChatGPT web)

---

### Phase 2: Concept Breakdown & Lesson Architecture

Deconstructed Chapter 8 into **9 lessons** organized in two parts:

**Part I: Git Concepts and Commands (100 min)** - Lessons 1-4
1. **Lesson 1**: Why Git Matters (15 min) - Motivation, safety context
2. **Lesson 2**: Essential Setup (25 min) - Installation, GitHub account, configuration
3. **Lesson 3**: The Daily Workflow (25 min) - Five core commands (init, status, add, commit, push)
4. **Lesson 4**: Safety Net (30 min) - Undo methods (diff, log, reset, revert)

**Part II: Natural Language Prompts (100 min)** - Lessons 5-8
5. **Lesson 5**: Branches for Experimentation (25 min) - Feature branches for safe testing
6. **Lesson 6**: GitHub Integration (20 min) - Remote setup, authentication, push/pull
7. **Lesson 7**: Pull Requests (30 min) - Code review workflow, documentation
8. **Lesson 8**: IDE Setup (25 min) - VS Code + Git integration + AI extensions

**Capstone Integration** - Lesson 9
9. **Lesson 9**: Capstone Exercise (30 min) - Full project workflow (calculator with AI, Git tracking, GitHub push, PR creation)

### Phase 2.5: Skills Proficiency Mapping

Mapped CEFR proficiency levels to each lesson:

**A1 (Beginner - Recognition)**:
- Lesson 1: Conceptual understanding of Git
- Lesson 2: Install and configure (one-time setup)
- Lesson 3: Core workflow (init, status, add, commit)
- Lesson 4: View changes (diff, log)
- Lesson 6: Add remote, push/pull (basic operations)
- Lesson 8: Install IDE, use GUI (visual interface)

**A2 (Beginner - Simple Application)**:
- Lesson 4: Undo methods (reset, revert - applying knowledge safely)
- Lesson 5: Create and merge branches (apply concept to real scenario)
- Lesson 6: Authenticate securely (choosing between options)
- Lesson 7: Create and review PRs (professional workflow)
- Lesson 8: Use IDE Git tools, install extensions (interacting with tools)
- Lesson 9: Integrated capstone (applying all skills together)

**Cognitive Load Theory Applied**:
- A1 lessons: Max 5 new concepts (Lessons 1-3: all stay within this)
- A2 lessons: Can handle up to 7 new concepts (Lessons 5-8 carefully designed)
- Each lesson: One primary skill per lesson (no topic overload)

### Phase 3: Topic Completeness & Gaps Analysis

Validated against Constitution Section II.C (Book Gaps Checklist):

**Factual Accuracy**: All links, commands, and platform-specific instructions flagged for verification during implementation

**Field Volatility**:
- GitHub UI (annual review trigger)
- Git versions (test on latest)
- IDE versions (test on latest)
- Python versions (verify with 3.13+)

**Inclusivity**:
- Three OS platforms covered (Windows, Mac, Linux) - avoids Windows-only bias
- Multiple IDE options presented (VS Code primary, Cursor, PyCharm, Zed alternatives)
- Two AI assistants supported (Claude Code, Gemini CLI) - avoids single vendor lock-in
- Jargon minimized; "time machine" metaphor used for Git
- Screenshots for every install step (visual learners)
- Diverse examples (not all from one scenario)

**Security Considerations**:
- SSH authentication explained (not just tokens)
- `.gitignore` prevents accidental API key commits
- Warnings: "Never commit secrets"
- Advice on revoking leaked credentials

**Real-World Appropriateness**:
- All examples reflect actual AI-assisted development patterns
- Branching matches professional practice
- PR workflow matches team norms
- IDE setup is production-ready
- Capstone is portfolio-ready

---

### Phase 4: Task Decomposition

Broke each lesson into specific, testable tasks:

**Task Organization**: Tasks organized by phase
1. **Phase 1**: Chapter structure (2-3h)
2. **Phases 2-10**: Content writing for each lesson (5-12h per lesson)
3. **Phase 11**: Code examples & validation (6-8h)
4. **Phase 12**: Review & integration (10-15h)
5. **Phase 13**: Finalization (6-8h)

**Task Priority**: MUST/SHOULD/NICE-TO-HAVE
- **MUST** (44 tasks): Chapter README, each lesson content, learning objectives, "Try With AI" sections, code examples, reviews
- **SHOULD** (8 tasks): Troubleshooting, extensions, alternative IDEs, peer review
- **NICE-TO-HAVE** (3 tasks): Maintenance documentation, diagrams, implementation notes

**Effort Estimate**: 40-50 hours writing + 10-15 hours review = 50-65 hours total

---

## Key Planning Decisions

### Decision 1: Nine-Lesson Structure (Instead of Eight)
- **Rationale**: Capstone exercise (Lesson 9) is substantive and deserves dedicated lesson
- **Trade-off**: Total chapter time increases slightly (estimated 3.5-4 hours vs 3-3.5 hours spec minimum)
- **Justification**: Capstone demonstrates full workflow integration; better learning outcome

### Decision 2: Part II as "AI Prompts" (Not Advanced Topics)
- **Rationale**: Spec explicitly requests "Part II teaches natural language prompts for AI assistants"
- **Interpretation**: Lessons 5-8 teach concepts PLUS how to ask AI to perform them
- **Implementation**: Every concept in Part II includes conversational examples and prompt templates

### Decision 3: IDE Lesson as Lesson 8 (Not Optional)
- **Rationale**: IDE setup is high-impact for professional development workflow
- **Trade-off**: Adds time to Part II
- **Justification**: By Lesson 8, students need IDE for both convenience and capstone project
- **Note**: Lesson 8 can be skipped if time is tight (can proceed with CLI)

### Decision 4: Max 4 IDE Options (Not 6+)
- **Rationale**: Tier 1 constraint: max 2 options, but 4 provides choice without overwhelming
- **Recommendation**: VS Code primary (80% of beginners)
- **Trade-off**: Mention alternatives (Cursor, PyCharm, Zed) as awareness
- **Justification**: Students can choose without analysis paralysis

### Decision 5: Personal Access Token (Not SSH First)
- **Rationale**: Simpler for absolute beginners
- **Trade-off**: Less secure than SSH, requires token management
- **Justification**: SSH is optional advanced step; token is entry-level
- **Note**: Both explained; recommend token for lesson, mention SSH for after

### Decision 6: Two Auth Options (Not One)
- **Rationale**: SSH is important for professionals; should be introduced
- **Implementation**: Token primary (mandatory for task), SSH secondary (SHOULD task)
- **Justification**: Token works for everyone; SSH is best practice for those who want it

---

## Scaffolding & Cognitive Load Strategy

### Tier 1 Constraints Applied Throughout

**Max 2 Options Per Lesson**:
- GitHub only (not GitLab, Bitbucket)
- VS Code primary (alternatives mentioned but not prioritized)
- Simple feature branches (no rebase, cherry-pick, interactive rebase)

**Max 5 Concepts Per Lesson**:
- Lesson 1: Git, time machine, commits, undo, backup (5)
- Lesson 2: Install, GitHub account, username/email, verification, first-time (5)
- Lesson 3: Init, status, add, commit, push (5)
- Lesson 4: Diff, log, reset soft, reset hard, revert (5)
- Lesson 5: Branch, main, feature, merge, delete (5)
- Lesson 6: Remote, origin, SSH/token, push, pull (5)
- Lesson 7: PR, diff, review, discussion, merge (5)
- Lesson 8: IDE, source control, diff viewer, extension, AI assistant (5)
- Lesson 9: Integration, workflow, safety, portfolio (integrated review)

**One Skill Per Lesson**:
- Each lesson builds ONE primary skill, not multiple

**Concept-First Pattern (WHAT → WHY → HOW → PRACTICE)**:
- Every concept explained conceptually first
- Purpose explained in context of AI-assisted development
- AI handles command execution (students don't memorize syntax)
- Hands-on practice reinforces understanding

- Installation verification (git --version, GitHub login, IDE launch)
- Workflow demonstration (init, commit, push, pull)
- Safety demonstration (diff, undo, branch-based testing)
- PR demonstration (create, review, merge)

**Comprehension Checks** (concept knowledge):
- Scenario questions: "You asked AI to refactor code. First step?" (answer: git diff)
- Safety questions: "You ran reset --hard. Is work recoverable?" (answer: no, but check GitHub)

**Success Metrics** (from spec):
- 90% successfully init, commit, undo within 30 min
- 85% create GitHub account and push within 1 hour
- 80% use branches to test AI changes safely
- 95% identify when to commit before AI changes
- 70% create PR with AI assistance documented
- Reading level: Grade 7 or below (Flesch-Kincaid)

### Artifact 3: PHR (This Document)

**Purpose**: Record planning decisions, context, methodology

---

## Decisions Needing Verification

### Before Implementation

1. **GitHub UI Stability**: Screenshot content may become outdated (maintenance trigger: check GitHub releases)
2. **Platform-Specific Instructions**: Needs actual testing on Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, Linux distributions
3. **AI Prompt Validation**: "Try With AI" prompts should be tested with Claude Code and Gemini CLI before publication
4. **Reading Level**: Flesch-Kincaid check needed (target: Grade 7 or below)

### After Initial Implementation

1. **User Testing**: Have beginner users follow lessons; gather friction points
2. **Technical Review**: Git commands and workflows reviewed by version control expert
3. **Accessibility Review**: Inclusive language, diverse examples, clear jargon
4. **Cross-Platform Validation**: Instructions tested on actual Windows, Mac, Linux machines

---

## Lessons Learned / Key Insights

1. **Tier 1 Cognitive Load is Real**: Max 5 concepts/lesson discipline forces clear prioritization and prevents information overload

2. **AIDD Changes Git Teaching**: When students use AI for commands, pedagogy shifts from "memorize syntax" to "understand intent and recognize when to use what"

3. **Safety-First Mindset Builds Confidence**: Explicit warnings and recovery procedures before destructive commands increases student willingness to experiment

4. **Two-Part Structure Works**: Separating Part I (concepts) from Part II (prompts) gives students understanding first, then asks them to communicate intent to AI

5. **Capstone is High-Value**: Full-workflow project exercises serves as both validation and portfolio piece

6. **Platform Diversity Matters**: Windows/Mac/Linux instructions avoid alienating students; increases accessibility

7. **Branch-Based Safety Pattern**: Using branches for experimentation (Lesson 5) is the key safety mechanism that makes AI collaboration manageable

---

## Recommendations for Lesson-Writer Subagent

When implementing this plan:

1. **Reference plan.md first**, not this summary
2. **Test as you go**: Git commands, AI prompts, platform-specific steps
3. **Capture screenshots immediately** while testing (don't defer)
4. **Write to project files** using Write tool (not just chat)
5. **Keep Tier 1 constraints visible** (max 5 concepts, max 2 options)
6. **Validate "Try With AI" prompts** with real AI assistants
7. **Create PHR for each lesson** (route to: `history/prompts/012-chapter-8-git-github-aidd/`)
8. **Verify files persist** to `book-source/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/08-git-and-github/` after writing
