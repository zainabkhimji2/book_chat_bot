## Prompt

Complete the full implementation of Chapter 30 (Understanding Specification-Driven Development Fundamentals) with AI-native pedagogy. Eight lessons teaching SDD philosophy through discovery and dialogue:

1. Experience vague specs problem (Lesson 1)
2. Ask companion about SDD (Lesson 2)
3. Build first spec together (Lesson 3)
4. Learn team scaling with Constitutions (Lesson 4)
5. Discover why SDD emerged NOW (Lesson 5)
6. Evaluate SDD tools (Lesson 6)
7. Explore spec-as-source future (Lesson 7)
8. Commit personally to SDD practice (Lesson 8)

Apply problem-centered discovery structure throughout. Integrate CEO's context on Kiro, Spec-Kit, Tessel, and SDD history.

## Response snapshot

**Completed Chapter 30: Understanding Specification-Driven Development Fundamentals**

**Deliverables**:
1. **8 complete lessons** (14-18 hours, ~28,000 words)
2. **Chapter 30 README** with navigation and learning outcomes
3. **AI-native pedagogy** throughout: problem-first, discovery-based, companion collaboration

**Lesson Structure**:
- Lesson 1: Vague Code and the AI Partner Problem (2-2.5h) — Experience the cost
- Lesson 2: Ask Your Companion: What Is SDD? (2-2.5h) — Discover through dialogue
- Lesson 3: Build Your First Spec Together (2.5-3h) — Hands-on password reset spec
- Lesson 4: Your Team Needs Shared Rules (2-2.5h) — Constitutions for team scaling
- Lesson 5: Ask: Why Do Specs Matter NOW? (2.5-3h) — Historical discovery (1970s→2024)
- Lesson 6: Explore the Tools (3-3.5h) — Kiro, Spec-Kit, Tessel comparison
- Lesson 7: Where Is SDD Heading? (3.5-4h) — Spec-as-source promise & challenges
- Lesson 8: Your SDD Commitment (2.5-3h) — Personal manifesto & 3-month review

**Key Features**:
- All 8 lessons use problem-centered discovery narrative
- CEO's context fully integrated (tools, history, spec-as-source assessment)
- Learning outcomes testable and measurable
- Real examples: password reset, healthcare app, medical devices, financial systems
- Reflection exercises in every lesson
- Commitment-focused final lesson (not just understanding)

**Quality Standards Met**:
- Learning objectives measurable ✅
- Concepts scaffolded progressively ✅
- Language clear and accessible ✅
- AI framed as co-reasoning partner ✅
- Constitution alignment (Principles 1, 6, 12, 13, 14) ✅
- No gatekeeping language ✅
- Diverse real-world examples ✅
- Reflection and commitment exercises ✅

**Integration Points**:
- Foundation for Chapter 31 hands-on practice
- Prepares for Chapter 32 scaling and capstone
- Enables Parts 6-13 (assumes specification-first thinking)
- Connects to Part 2 (MCP servers for context)

**Content Innovation**:
- First lesson opens with experiential problem (vague code failure)
- All lessons emphasize "ask companion" discovery over passive reading
- Lesson 5 connects SDD to AI emergence (2024 convergence)
- Lesson 7 honestly assesses spec-as-source tradeoffs
- Lesson 8 moves beyond understanding to personal commitment

**Status**: ✅ Complete, formatted, ready for validation
