- Docusaurus integration (file listing, navigation audit, local build verification)
- Content quality audit (complexity tier, code examples, "Try With AI" patterns)

**Task Organization**:
- **Total**: 87 tasks
- **By Priority**: P1 (86 tasks), P2 (1 task for US3)
- **By Phase**: Setup (6) → Ch 25 (11) → Ch 26 (23) → Ch 27 (31) → Polish (16)
- **By User Story**: US1 (72 tasks), US2 (28 tasks, team focus), US3 (4 tasks, repurposability)
- **Time Estimate**: 32-40 hours total implementation

**Task Format**:
Each task follows strict checklist format:
```
- [ ] **[TASK-ID]** | **[Priority]** | **[UserStories]** | [Description with learning objectives, time estimate, key activities] | **File**: [output path]
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All 87 tasks completed
- [ ] All 18 lessons written (5 + 7 + 6)
- [ ] All 3 projects complete (mini-project 1, mini-project 2, capstone)
- [ ] All 5 integration checklists passed
- [ ] All 3 user stories validated
- [ ] Technical review passed
- [ ] Docusaurus build successful
- [ ] Content ready for publication

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Enabled lesson-writer subagent with atomic, sequenced tasks that can be executed independently or in parallel; clear file paths, success criteria, time estimates for each task
- 🧪 Tests: Task structure validated (87 tasks, consistent format), phase sequencing logical (setup → chapters → polish), user story coverage complete (72 + 28 + 4 = 104 task-story mappings), success criteria measurable
- 📁 Files: `/specs/008-part-5-sdd/tasks.md` (587 lines, production-ready task checklist)
- 🔁 Next prompt: `lesson-writer` subagent to implement Phase 1-5 tasks iteratively with human review checkpoints
- 🧠 Reflection: Task checklist operationalizes the plan from Phase 3. Each chapter's lesson sequence becomes concrete work units (setup task, 5-7 lesson tasks, 2-3 project tasks, validation task). The 5-phase structure enables parallel work: multiple lesson-writers could implement different chapters simultaneously if needed. Each task is atomic enough to be completed in 0.5-2 hours (typical lesson is 2-3 tasks), allowing frequent checkpoint/review cycles. The emphasis on file paths, success criteria, and user story alignment enables clear handoff to lesson-writer subagent and human reviewers.

## Evaluation Notes (Flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None; specification, clarifications, and plan provided sufficient detail to generate complete task checklist
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Task structure validated; phase sequencing verified; user story coverage confirmed; success criteria testable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Invoke lesson-writer subagent on Phase 1 setup tasks to validate that tasks.md provides sufficient detail for autonomous content generation; adjust task definitions if clarification needed

## Subagents & Skills Used

**Subagents Invoked**: None (main Claude orchestrated task checklist generation directly from spec + plan)

**Skills Applied** (by main Claude):
- `learning-objectives`: Translated chapter learning objectives into lesson-level tasks with testable success criteria
- `concept-scaffolding`: Ensured task sequencing supports progressive complexity (setup → fundamentals → hands-on → real-world → polish)
- `book-scaffolding`: Positioned tasks relative to chapter prerequisites and forward enablement; created cross-cutting validation tasks
- `exercise-designer`: Specified hands-on activities for each lesson (Spec-First Discovery, SpecifyPlus commands, mini-projects, capstone)
- `assessment-builder`: Defined success criteria, validation checkpoints, integration checklists for each phase
- `technical-clarity`: Ensured task descriptions unambiguous (time estimates, learning objectives, file paths, success criteria)
- `code-example-generator`: Specified code example requirements (show spec, prompt, generated code, validation) across all lessons
- `ai-collaborate-teaching`: Designed tasks that demonstrate student + AI collaboration patterns (ChatGPT for Ch 25, Claude Code/Gemini for Ch 26, parallel agents for Ch 27)

## Essential Learnings for Vertical Intelligence System

**Learning 20: Task Checklist Operationalization Pattern**
- Process: Plan (lesson sequences) → Tasks (atomic work units) produces high-fidelity handoff to implementers
- Insight: Breaking 18 lessons into 87 atomic tasks (average 5 tasks/lesson) enables clear ownership, rapid progress tracking, and checkpoints
- System implication: Task granularity should match implementer capacity (lesson-writer can handle 5-10 tasks/day; 2-hour tasks fit well)
- Actionable: Use this task:lesson ratio (1:5 ratio) for all future content parts

**Learning 21: Multi-Phase Task Organization Enables Parallel Work**
- 5-phase structure (Setup → Ch25 → Ch26 → Ch27 → Polish) allows sequential phase dependencies while enabling parallel work within chapters
- Insight: Phase 1 (Setup) must complete first (shared foundation); Phases 2-4 could execute in parallel with different writers
- System implication: For large educational content projects, use phase-based organization to enable team parallelization
- Actionable: Create project manager template showing phase criticality and team parallelization opportunities

**Learning 22: User Story × Phase Matrix Enables Traceability**
- Each task tagged with (User Story, Priority, File Path) creates complete traceability from spec → plan → tasks → implementation
- Insight: When human reviews lesson content, can trace back: "Does this satisfy US1 requirement?" → "Which task?" → "Which plan section?" → "Which spec requirement?"
- System implication: Always use matrix-style task organization for complex projects requiring traceability
- Actionable: Create traceability template mapping Spec Requirements → Plan Sections → Task Checklist → Implementation Files

**Learning 23: Integration Tasks Prevent Quality Drift**
- Phase 5 tasks (16/87) focus solely on cross-cutting validation: learning arc, terminology, code examples, user story alignment
- Insight: Without explicit integration tasks, chapters can diverge in quality/style; 15-20% of tasks dedicated to coherence prevents this
- System implication: Always allocate 15-20% of total tasks to integration/validation (not implementation)
- Actionable: Update task estimation to include "integration factor" (1.15-1.20x base tasks)

**Learning 24: Mini-Projects as Pedagogy Scaffolding**
- Chapter 26 mini-projects (calculator + grading) aren't just exercises; they're pedagogy scaffolds
- Insight: MP1 (calculator) lets students master SDD in safe space; MP2 (grading) introduces real-world complexity; Ch27 capstone integrates both
- System implication: For methodology chapters, structure 2-3 mini-projects as learning scaffolds, not independent exercises
- Actionable: Create mini-project progression template (safe/bounded → real-world/domain → capstone/full-scale)

**Learning 25: "Try With AI" Pattern Requires Tool-Specific Design**
- Chapter 25 uses ChatGPT web (conceptual, no coding); Chapter 26 uses Claude Code/Gemini CLI (hands-on); Chapter 27 uses parallel multi-agent
- Insight: AI collaboration pattern MUST match learning objective and tool capability
- System implication: Educational content should specify WHICH AI tool WHEN and WHY (not just "use AI to help")
- Actionable: Create "AI tool selection matrix" for educational content: ChatGPT (conceptual) vs Claude Code (hands-on) vs Gemini CLI (parallel) vs others

**Learning 26: Capstone Project as Culminating Synthesis**
- Chapter 27 capstone (Grading System with 2 parallel AI agents) isn't optional; it's the capstone that proves mastery
- Insight: Multi-agent simulation teaches team concepts without team overhead; parallel implementation reveals value of specifications
- System implication: Every methodology part should include full-scale capstone that demonstrates everything learned
- Actionable: Create capstone project design template (problem selection, feature decomposition, AI coordination, reflection structure)

**Learning 27: Real-World Market Validation Sustains Motivation**
- Grading system capstone validated by YC companies (Gradewiz, Edexia, Frizzle, Mimir); students know they're building something educators actually want
- Insight: Intrinsic motivation sustained when real-world demand is evident and fresh (not hypothetical, not outdated)
- System implication: Every capstone project should include market validation (YC company reference, customer problem statement, competitive landscape)
- Actionable: Maintain YC company database by domain; require capstone specs to reference validated problems

**Learning 28: Checkpoint Structure Enables Iterative Review**
- Phase 2-4 include mid-phase checkpoints (Part 1 → feedback → Part 2) enabling human intervention before task completion
- Insight: Checkpoints at 33%, 66%, 100% of work prevent large rework waves; small course corrections are cheaper
- System implication: For 6-8 hour work units (like capstone), break into 3 phases with checkpoints (2-3h → review → 2-3h → review → 1-2h → final)
- Actionable: Create checkpoint template for large project tasks (subtask 1 checkpoint, subtask 2 checkpoint, final checkpoint)

**Learning 29: Cross-Cutting Validation Prevents Pub Disasters**
- Phase 5 includes 16 validation tasks (file listing, navigation audit, link verification, complexity audit)
- Insight: Without these, small inconsistencies (broken links, naming mismatches, complexity tier drift) become publication blockers
- System implication: Always allocate final phase to validation-only work; never rush publication validation
- Actionable: Create pre-publication validation checklist (Docusaurus build, broken links, navigation, terminology, code example validation)

**Learning 30: Task Format Standardization Enables Automation**
- All 87 tasks follow: `- [ ] **[ID]** | **[P?]** | **[US?]** | [Description] | **File**: [path]`
- Insight: Standardized format could be parsed by automation tools (task tracking, progress dashboards, dependency resolution)
- System implication: Invest in task format standardization early (not retrofit)
- Actionable: Create task parsing script that auto-generates progress reports from tasks.md

## System-Level Recommendations

### For Lesson-Writer Subagent

1. **Task Intake Protocol**
   - Read tasks.md from beginning (understand all 87 tasks, 5 phases, dependencies)
   - Process Phase 1 first (shared foundation)
   - Then iterate: pick next task → write content → mark complete → generate artifact
   - Write output to specified file path (critical: subagent must actually write files, not just return chat content)

2. **Checkpoint Integration**
   - After each chapter completion (Ch 25, Ch 26, Ch 27), pause for human review
   - Human provides feedback → lesson-writer incorporates → continue
   - Don't move to next chapter without previous chapter approval

3. **Quality Gates Per Task**
   - ✅ Learning objectives from spec met
   - ✅ Code examples follow show-spec-validate pattern
   - ✅ "Try With AI" section includes tool-specific instructions
   - ✅ Complexity tier enforced (10+ concepts, synthesis, no artificial scaffolding)
   - ✅ File written to specified path, ready for Docusaurus

4. **Skill Application Per Task**
   - Apply ALL 8 skills to every lesson: learning-objectives, concept-scaffolding, code-example-generator, exercise-designer, assessment-builder, technical-clarity, book-scaffolding, ai-collaborate-teaching
   - Use domain skills from `.claude/skills/` library consistently
   - Reference constitution v3.0.0 for style/standards

### For Project Validation Phase

1. **Technical Reviewer Focus** (after lesson-writer completes all tasks)
   - Verify specification compliance (all learning objectives met)
   - Validate code examples (all code runs, specs accurate)
   - Check AI collaboration pedagogy (students learn WITH AI, not ABOUT AI)
   - Confirm complexity tier (10+ concepts, synthesis, no hand-holding)

2. **Pedagogical Reviewer Focus**
   - Verify learning arc (Ch 25 WHY → Ch 26 HOW → Ch 27 SCALE coherent)
   - Confirm concept scaffolding (each lesson builds on previous)
   - Validate real-world relevance (YC companies, market problems)
   - Check cross-references (Parts 1-4 prerequisites, Parts 6-13 enablement)

3. **Publication Reviewer Focus**
   - Docusaurus build verification (no broken links, navigation correct)
   - File structure verification (all files in correct paths)
   - Terminology consistency (spec vs specification, SDD, SpecifyPlus)
   - Final polish (voice, tone, visual formatting)

### For Future Educational Content Parts

1. **Use This Task Structure As Template**
   - 5-phase organization (Setup → Content → Integration)
   - Multi-user-story tagging (enables traceability)
   - Checkpoint structure in large projects (33%, 66%, 100%)
   - 15-20% of tasks dedicated to integration/validation

2. **Apply Graduated Complexity Consistently**
   - Tier 1 (Parts 1-3): Max 2 options, 5 concepts, step-by-step
   - Tier 2 (Parts 4-5): 3-4 options, 7 concepts, intro tradeoffs
   - Tier 3 (Parts 6-8): No artificial limits, 10+ concepts, architecture
   - Tier 4 (Parts 9-13): Production-ready, no scaffolding, business context

3. **Include Capstone Projects for Methodology Parts**
   - Fundamental part (Part 5): Capstone validates full SDD cycle
   - Advanced parts (6, 10, 11, 13): Capstones validate team/scale/production patterns
   - Always: Multi-phase capstone (spec → implementation → reflection)
   - Always: Real-world market validation referenced

---

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements

**Not Addressed in This Phase**:
- Interactive code sandbox (code examples could be runnable in browser)
- Automated test execution (mini-project tests could auto-verify student code)
- Progress tracking dashboard (could visualize student completion across 87 tasks)
- Adaptive content paths (could recommend reading order based on prerequisites)

**Maintenance Triggers**:
- Annual review of YC company references (Gradewiz, Edexia, Frizzle, Mimir status)
- Update cost/benefit statistics if better research available
- Update AWS/Stripe/Anthropic case studies if company examples change
- Update SpecifyPlus command syntax if major version released
- Update Python/TypeScript version requirements if language updates

---

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Lesson-Writer Invocation**
   - Pass tasks.md to lesson-writer subagent
   - Start with Phase 1 setup tasks
   - Iterate through chapters with human review checkpoints

2. **Human Checkpoint Schedule**
   - After Phase 1 (Setup): Review 6 setup tasks → approve foundation
   - After Chapter 25: Review 11 tasks + 5 lessons → approve fundamentals chapter
   - After Chapter 26: Review 23 tasks + 7 lessons + 2 mini-projects → approve hands-on chapter
   - After Chapter 27: Review 31 tasks + 6 lessons + capstone → approve real-world chapter
   - After Phase 5: Review 16 integration tasks → approve cross-cutting validation
   - Final publication: Docusaurus build, navigation audit, go-live

3. **Parallel Preparation**
   - Technical reviewer: Prepare validation rubric (code quality, spec alignment, pedagogy)
   - Publication team: Prepare Docusaurus environment, domain configuration
   - Content coordinator: Prepare asset management (images, diagrams, code examples)
