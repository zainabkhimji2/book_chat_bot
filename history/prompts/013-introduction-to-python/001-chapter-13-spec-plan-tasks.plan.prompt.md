# Chapter 13 Python Orchestration: Complete Spec-Plan-Tasks Workflow

## PROMPT TEXT

```
/sp.python-chapter 13

Write Chapter 13: Introduction to Modern Python in Part 4

Core Context & Guiding Philosophy:

This chapter must reflect modern AIDD principles:
* AI-Driven Learning: Students use Claude Code or Gemini CLI as coding partners
* Focus on reasoning and problem-solving, NOT syntax memorization
* AIDD-First: Clarify what you want BEFORE writing code
* Validation-First: Test understanding, not just memorize

Existing Teaching Materials:
@context/13_chap12_to_29_specs/Lesson_01_Introduction_to_Python.md
@context/13_chap12_to_29_specs/readme.md

Additional Guidance:
* Target: Absolute beginners (no coding experience)
* Scope: Introduction fundamentals only and why learn python using AIDD Now (not Chapter 14's Data Types)
* Emphasis: Your first Python program + AIDD thinking
```

**User Updates to tasks.md**:
1. Replace `index.md` with `readme.md` (chapter intro with overview and learning objectives)
2. Remove T004 (no visuals/screenshots for now)
3. Remove T005-T011 (Phase 2 foundational assets) - code examples embedded in lessons only
4. For every lesson: Apply full constitution and formatting guidelines

## RESPONSE TEXT

**Completed Phases**:

### PHASE 0: Context Gathering ✅
- Validated Chapter 13: "Introduction to Python" (Part 4: Python Fundamentals)
- Confirmed dual-path design: Absolute beginners + professionals transitioning to AIDD
- Scope: Introduction fundamentals + first program ONLY
- Outcome: Interactive greeting program (asks name, prints greeting)
- AIDD Integration: AI partnership (students use Claude Code/Gemini as co-teacher)

### PHASE 1: Specification ✅
**File**: `specs/part-4-chapter-13/spec.md` (720+ lines)

**Design**:
- 5 core concepts (respects AIDD Principle #12 cognitive load)
- 5 success evals (business-goal aligned: 80%+ installation, 80%+ first program, 75%+ AI partnership, 70%+ spec-first practice)
- 5 user stories (beginners + professionals)
- 4 lessons (45 + 30 + 45 + 30 minutes)
- Dual-path: 🟦 CORE (all students) + 🟪 PROFESSIONAL (experienced developers)
- No forward references (zero mentions of Chapters 14+)

**Key Features**:
- Evals-First: Success evals defined before learning objectives
- Specification-First: Clear intent before AI interactions
- AIDD Reinforcement: Chapters 4 (spec-first), 5 (Claude Code), 6 (Gemini), 7 (Bash), 10 (prompting)

### PHASE 2: Planning ✅
**File**: `specs/part-4-chapter-13/plan.md` (720+ lines)

**Design**:
- 4-lesson progression (A1 → A1 → A2 → A2-B1 using CEFR standards)
- AIDD teaching pattern applied: What it is → Code → Think with Your AI → Why it matters
- 3-4 specific Claude Code/Gemini prompts per lesson (exploration-oriented, not generic)
- Cognitive load validated: 2 concepts per lesson, max 10 total
- Prior chapter connections explicit (Ch 1-12)
- Foundation for Chapter 14 (Data Types) validated

**CEFR Proficiency Mapping**:
- Lesson 1: A1 (Recognition) - Students identify Python, recognize relevance
- Lesson 2: A1 (Guided Procedure) - Students follow installation steps
- Lesson 3: A2 (Simple Application) - Students write/run first program with scaffolding
- Lesson 4: A2-B1 (Independent Application) - Students apply specification-first methodology

### PHASE 3: Tasks (UPDATED) ✅
**File**: `specs/part-4-chapter-13/tasks.md` (435+ lines, 58 total tasks)

**Streamlined Structure** (per user updates):
- **Phase 1**: Setup (T001-T002) - Create chapter directory + readme.md placeholder
- **Phase 2**: Lesson 1 (T003-T011) - "What is Python and Why AIDD Needs It"
- **Phase 3**: Lesson 2 (T012-T021) - "Installing Python & Setting Up Environment"
- **Phase 4**: Lesson 3 (T022-T030) - "Your First Program"
- **Phase 5**: Lesson 4 (T031-T038) - "Thinking Like an AI-First Developer" (Professional only)
- **Phase 6**: Validation & Integration (T039-T054) - Code verification, pattern validation, chapter integration
- **Phase 7**: Final Review & Sign-Off (T055-T058) - Self-review, technical review, publication prep

**Key Additions (per user request)**:
- ✅ Constitution Alignment section (Evals-First, Specification-First, AI Partnership, Validation-First, etc.)
- ✅ Output Style Guidelines section (YAML Frontmatter, Lesson Structure, Metadata, Cognitive Load)
- ✅ Every lesson task includes full YAML frontmatter requirements (title, chapter, lesson, duration, skills, cognitive load, generation metadata)
- ✅ AIDD pattern explicitly enforced in every lesson task
- ✅ Code examples embedded in lessons (no separate directory)
- ✅ readme.md replaces index.md (chapter intro with learning objectives)
- ✅ Constitutional principles referenced throughout
- ✅ Formatting guidelines from `.claude/output-styles/lesson.md` applied

**Task Organization**:
- 58 total tasks (was 72 due to streamlining)
- Each lesson clearly marked with CEFR level and cognitive load
- Dual paths clearly marked (🟦 CORE / 🟪 PROFESSIONAL)
- Dependencies shown (sequential phases + parallel opportunities)
- Acceptance criteria explicit for each task
- All tasks reference spec.md, plan.md, constitution.md

**Quality Metrics**:
- MVP: 4-6 hours (Phases 1-4 + core validation)
- Full: 6-8 hours (all phases including professional path + full review)
- Parallelizable: Lessons 1-4 can run in parallel after Phase 1

## DESIGN ARTIFACTS SUMMARY

| Artifact | Status | Key Details |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **Specification** | ✅ Complete | 5 concepts, 5 evals, 4 lessons, dual-path, no forward refs |
| **Plan** | ✅ Complete | 4-lesson CEFR progression, AIDD pattern, AI prompts specified |
| **Tasks** | ✅ Complete & Updated | 58 tasks, constitution + formatting integrated, MVP to full scope |

## NEXT STEPS

Ready for **PHASE 4: Implementation** (optional).

**Three Options**:

**A) Implement with lesson-writer subagent** (Automated)
   - Launches lesson-writer agent to auto-create all lesson `.md` files
   - Time: 2-3 hours
   - Output: Complete chapter ready for technical review

**B) Implement manually** (Self-paced)
   - Use tasks.md as detailed implementation checklist
   - Follow constitutional + formatting guidelines
   - Create each lesson per specification
   - Time: 4-6 hours (MVP) to 6-8 hours (full)

**C) Done for now** (Design phase complete)
   - Keep design artifacts
   - Implement when ready
   - Return to workflow later
