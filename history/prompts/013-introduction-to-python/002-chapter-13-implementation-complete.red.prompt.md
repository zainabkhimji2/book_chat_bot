## QUALITY VALIDATION RESULTS

### Constitutional Alignment (8/8 ✓)

✅ **Evals-First Design**
- All 5 success evals from spec.md are measurable and achievable through lesson content
- Each lesson enables specific eval validation (installation success, program execution, AI partnership, spec-first practice)

✅ **Specification-First**
- Every section shows INTENT before AI interaction
- Lesson 4 teaches full pattern: Specify intent → Ask AI → Validate → Refine
- Students learn to write plain-language specs before asking AI to code

✅ **AI as Co-Reasoning Partner**
- All "Think with Your AI" prompts guide THINKING, not code memorization
- 13 total prompts across 4 lessons, 3-4 per lesson
- Both Claude Code and Gemini CLI equally supported

✅ **Validation-First**
- Each lesson includes explicit checkpoint questions
- Students test understanding before moving forward
- Validations measure thinking comprehension, not code execution

✅ **Bilingual Development**
- Python introduced as reasoning layer (reasoning in Python, interaction in TypeScript later)
- Foundation laid for TypeScript in later chapters

✅ **Learning by Building**
- Installation from scratch (real Python setup, not simulation)
- First program builds incrementally (step-by-step scaffolding)
- Specification practice with real code examples

✅ **Progressive Complexity (CEFR Levels)**
- Lesson 1: A1 (Recognition) — Identify Python, recognize relevance
- Lesson 2: A1 (Guided Procedure) — Follow installation steps
