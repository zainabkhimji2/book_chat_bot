## Prompt

Monetization is later; focus on Optimization for Search and Answer Engines.

## Response snapshot

- Left monetization schema for later. Updated quickstart with structured-data validator steps (no content edits) and created a report template for 10 target pages. Answerability lint remains report-only.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Clear path to validate SEO/AEO improvements without touching content.
- 🧪 Tests: Report templates ready; next step is to run validators and fill results.
- 📁 Files: quickstart updated; report templates created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run validator on 10 URLs; record results; iterate if any schema errors.
- 🧠 Reflection: Evidence-first policy preserved; monetization can be layered later behind flags.
