## Prompt Text

Based on specification, implementation plan, and documented requirements, generate comprehensive tasks checklist for Chapter 31 redesign. Organize by user story (learning objective), ensure each task is atomic and independently testable, include 47 tasks across 10 phases covering:

Phase 1: Setup (branch initialization)
Phase 2: Foundational architecture (lesson templates, rubrics, glossary)
Phase 3-8: User Stories 1-5 + Implementation (7 lessons + capstone)
Phase 9: Capstone project
Phase 10: Validation & publication

Each task must:

- Follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P] [Story] Description with file path`
- Be specific enough for LLM to execute without additional context
- Include file paths (absolute or relative to project)
- Be independently testable when part of story phase
- Use "Try With AI" pattern (ChatGPT web for Lessons 1-3, CLI tools for Lessons 4-7)
- Show correct SpecifyPlus command usage (within Claude Code, NOT terminal)

Include:

- Dependency graph showing story completion order
- Parallel execution strategy
- MVP scope (Lessons 1-3 + simple capstone)
- Phase 2+ extension (tool integration lessons 4-7)
- Capstone rubric
- Success criteria for chapter completion

Output: /specs/10-chapter-31-redesign/tasks.md (fully detailed, immediately executable)

- Create completion checklist (T049)

### Key Features

**Lesson Organization**:

- 7 lessons + 1 capstone = 8 major learning units
- Each lesson has 5-6 supporting tasks (content, examples, exercises, assessment, prompts)
- All lessons end with "Try With AI" activity (no "Key Takeaways" or "Next Steps")
- Lessons 1-3 use ChatGPT web; Lessons 4-7 use student's preferred CLI tool

**SpecifyPlus Command Usage**:
✅ All `/sp.specify`, `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, `/sp.implement` shown within Claude Code
✅ NOT shown as standalone terminal commands
✅ Correct workflow and context demonstrated

**Parallel Opportunities**:

- Phase 2 (Foundational): T003-T008 can execute in parallel
- Each lesson: Content and examples can parallel, exercises depend on content
- Capstone: T045-T046 can parallel

**Dependency Graph**:

- Setup (Phase 1) → Foundational (Phase 2) → Lessons 1-7 (Phases 3-8)
- Lessons 1-3 (manual thinking) → Lessons 4-7 (tools) → Capstone (integration)
- Capstone depends on all lessons complete
- Validation depends on all content created

**MVP Strategy**:

- **MVP Scope**: Lessons 1-3 + Simple Capstone (Calculator)
- **Time**: 8-10 hours
- **Rationale**: Proves spec-first thinking before tools
- **Extension**: Lessons 4-7 + Complex Capstone (Grading System)

### Assessment & Rubrics

Each lesson includes:

- **Pass Criteria**: What students must demonstrate
- **Rubric**: How quality is measured (Excellent/Good/Satisfactory/Needs Work)
- **Independent Test**: Can be validated without other lessons

**Capstone Rubric**:

- Specification completeness and clarity
- Plan logical structure and dependencies
- Tasks atomic and well-sequenced
- Code passes all acceptance criteria
- Reflection demonstrates learning

**Chapter Completion Checklist**:

- [ ] All 7 lessons written
- [ ] All "Try With AI" activities present
- [ ] All `/sp.*` commands within Claude Code
- [ ] Hallucinations eliminated
- [ ] Code examples tested
- [ ] Cascade demonstrated
- [ ] Constitutional alignment verified
- [ ] Ready for publication

### Implementation Roadmap

**Week 1: Foundation (MVP)**

- Phase 1-2: Setup & foundational templates
- Phase 3-5: Lessons 1-3 (SMART, Structure, Specs)
- Time: ~8-10 hours

**Week 2: Tools**

- Phase 6-8: Lessons 4-7 (Refinement, Planning, Implementation)
- Time: ~8-10 hours

**Week 3: Capstone**

- Phase 9: Capstone project
- Time: ~3-5 hours

**Week 4: Validation**

- Phase 10: Final validation, publication readiness
- Time: ~2-3 hours

**Total**: 16-20 hours
