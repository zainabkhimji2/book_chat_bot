## Prompt Text

You are the chapter-planner subagent. Your task is to generate a detailed implementation plan for Chapter 31: SpecifyPlus Hands-On.

**Input Context**:

- Feature Specification: /specs/10-chapter-31-redesign/spec.md
- Output Plan File: /specs/10-chapter-31-redesign/plan.md
- Constitution: .specify/memory/constitution.md
- Feature Branch: 10-chapter-31-redesign
- Project: CoLearning Python Book (Part 5: Specification-Driven Development)

**Your Task**:

1. Read the specification and constitution
2. Fill the plan template following 10-section structure
3. Apply specification-first, co-learning, cascade, and graduated complexity principles
4. Validate cognitive load and constitutional alignment
5. Generate supporting artifacts (research.md if needed)
6. Output: /specs/10-chapter-31-redesign/plan.md fully filled

**Critical Requirements**:

- Transform spec into detailed lesson-by-lesson implementation plan
- Apply skills-proficiency-mapper skill for CEFR/Bloom's metadata
- Focus on planning: lesson sequence, learning architecture, dependencies
- No tasks.md generation (that's Phase 3: /sp.tasks)
- No lesson content generation (that's Phase 4: lesson-writer)

### Skills Proficiency Mapping

**CEFR Progression**:

- **A2 (Lessons 1-3)**: Recognition + simple application with scaffolding

  - SMART framework (Lesson 1)
  - Project structure (Lesson 2)
  - Specification components (Lesson 3)

- **B1 (Lessons 4-6)**: Application to unfamiliar problems independently

  - Specification refinement with `/sp.specify` (Lesson 4)
  - Plan generation with `/sp.plan` (Lesson 5)
  - Task decomposition with `/sp.tasks` (Lesson 6)

- **B2 (Lesson 7 + Capstone)**: Integration, evaluation, design decisions
  - AI-driven implementation with `/sp.implement` (Lesson 7)
  - End-to-end project execution (Capstone)

**Bloom's Taxonomy**:

- **Understand + Apply** (Lessons 1-3): Learn concepts, apply to grading system
- **Apply + Analyze** (Lessons 4-6): Use tools, understand how spec cascades through pipeline
- **Analyze + Evaluate + Create** (Lesson 7): Validate code, refine based on feedback
- **Create** (Capstone): Design and execute complete project

**Cognitive Load Validation**:

- ✅ A2 Lessons: Max 5-7 new concepts per lesson
- ✅ B1 Lessons: Max 7 new concepts per lesson
- ✅ B2 Lesson: 8 concepts (integration level)
- ✅ No artificial limits; graduated progression

### Learning Progression Map

Tool-Assisted Thinking (Lessons 4-7)
    ↓
Full Workflow Integration (Capstone)

Spec Quality → Plan Quality → Task Quality → Code Quality

Co-Learning Competency
```

### Dependencies & Sequencing

**Hard Dependencies**:

- Lesson 1 → Lesson 2 (SMART criteria foundation)
- Lesson 2 → Lesson 3 (project structure knowledge)
- Lesson 3 → Lesson 4 (complete spec required for `/sp.specify`)
- Lesson 4 → Lesson 5 (refined spec required for `/sp.plan`)
- Lesson 5 → Lesson 6 (plan required for `/sp.tasks`)
- Lesson 6 → Lesson 7 (tasks required for `/sp.implement`)
- Lesson 7 → Capstone (all skills required)

**Optional Dependencies**:

- Students can review earlier lessons while working on later ones
- Capstone projects can use either simple (calculator) or complex (grading) domains

### Constitutional Alignment

**Principle 14 (Planning-First)**: ✅ All 7 lessons enforce spec-first thinking
**Principle 15 (Validation-Before-Trust)**: ✅ Every lesson includes validation activity
**Core Skills**: ✅ All 14 domain skills integrated throughout
**AI-First Teaching**: ✅ "Try With AI" activity in every lesson
**Co-Learning**: ✅ Human intent → AI generation → human validation → AI refinement

### Risk Analysis & Mitigations

**Risk 1**: Students don't grasp why manual thinking matters before tools

- **Mitigation**: Explicitly show problem (vague criteria → bad code) before showing solution (SMART framework)
- **Prevention**: Lesson 1 is experiential, not theoretical

**Risk 2**: Tool usage is complex; students get lost in CLI

- **Mitigation**: Each lesson focuses on ONE tool; previous lessons build foundation
- **Prevention**: Capstone integrates all tools in real project context

**Risk 3**: Spec-first thinking is still not intuitive

- **Mitigation**: Cascade effect demonstrated at EACH lesson level
- **Prevention**: Students see cause-and-effect: bad spec → bad plan → bad tasks → bad code

**Risk 4**: Students skip specification thinking and jump to coding

- **Mitigation**: `/sp.specify` and `/sp.plan` require complete specs as input
- **Prevention**: Tool workflow enforces spec-first discipline

**Risk 5**: Capstone project scope creeps

- **Mitigation**: Provide fixed specification to students; they implement, don't design
- **Prevention**: Clear rubric with fixed acceptance criteria

**Risk 6**: Students don't validate code thoroughly

- **Mitigation**: Lesson 7 emphasizes validation as core skill, not optional
- **Prevention**: Every acceptance criterion must explicitly pass before code is accepted

### Assessment Strategy

**Formative Assessments** (Daily, embedded in lessons):

- Lesson 1: SMART criteria template completion + peer review
- Lesson 2: Explanation of cascade principle
- Lesson 3: Complete specification with all sections
- Lesson 4: Refined specification showing gap resolution
- Lesson 5: Plan analysis and dependency understanding
- Lesson 6: Task decomposition and lineage tracing
- Lesson 7: Code validation checklist (every criterion must pass)

**Summative Assessment** (Capstone):

- Specification completeness and clarity
- Plan quality and logical sequencing
- Code passes all acceptance criteria
- Reflection demonstrates learning and metacognition

**Assessment Rubrics**:

- **SMART Criteria** (Lesson 1): Testable? Measurable? Achievable? (3-point scale)
- **Specification** (Lesson 3): All 6 components present? Clear? Complete? (3-point scale)
- **Plan Quality** (Lesson 5): Phases logical? Dependencies clear? Feasible? (3-point scale)
- **Code Validation** (Lesson 7): Criteria met? Tests pass? Documentation clear? (Pass/Fail per criterion)
- **Capstone** (Final): All deliverables complete? Reflection insightful? (Rubric: Excellent/Good/Satisfactory/Needs Work)

### Constitutional Alignment Check

**Book Gaps Checklist** (from constitution):

- ✅ Factual Accuracy: SpecifyPlus commands verified, no hallucinations
- ✅ Field Volatility: AI tools, SDD practices evolving; content stays current
- ✅ Inclusive Language: All examples gender-neutral, accessible
