## PROMPT TEXT

Implement Lesson 1: Why Markdown Matters for AI Communication

Context:
- Chapter: 9 - Markdown: The Language of AI Communication
- Part: Part 3 - Markdown, Prompt & Context Engineering
- Lesson file: book-source/docs/03-Markdown-Prompt-Context-Engineering/09-markdown-language-of-ai/01-why-markdown-matters.md
- Spec: specs/001-chapter-9-markdown/spec.md
- Plan: specs/001-chapter-9-markdown/plan.md
- Tasks: Task T007 from specs/001-chapter-9-markdown/tasks.md

Lesson Requirements (from plan.md and tasks.md):

Duration: 40 minutes
Proficiency Level: A1 (Foundation)
Concepts: 2 (Light cognitive load)
Skills Taught:
- Understanding Markdown's Role (A1 - Remember - Information Literacy)
- Recognizing Specification Intent (A1 - Understand - Content Creation)

Core Concepts to Cover:
1. Markdown as structured text (human-readable + machine-parseable)
2. Markdown's role in AIDD Intent Layer (specifications → AI reasoning → implementation)

Content Structure (from plan):
1. Introduction: Why markdown exists and solves real problems
2. Concept 1: Markdown as structured text
   - Human-readable (plain text, no special software needed)
   - Machine-parseable (AI can understand structure)
   - Example: Compare plain text vs markdown vs rendered output
3. Concept 2: Markdown's role in Intent Layer
   - Three-layer AIDD architecture: Intent Layer (specs in markdown) → Reasoning Layer (AI parses) → Implementation (code generation)
   - How clear markdown specs lead to better AI-generated code
4. Real-world context:
   - GitHub README files (every repository)
   - AI prompt engineering (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini understand markdown)
   - Technical documentation (Docusaurus, this book itself!)
5. Try With AI section (ONLY closure element):
   - Activity: Ask ChatGPT web "Why does markdown matter for working with AI coding agents?"
   - Reflection: Compare AI's response with lesson concepts
   - Note: Using ChatGPT web (pre-tool chapters)

Assessment: Discussion participation + comprehension check

Constitutional Requirements:
- Reading level: Grade 7-8 (Flesch-Kincaid)
- No "ask your AI" for foundational concepts (book teaches directly)
- End with ONLY "Try With AI" section (no "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next")
- All 8 domain skills applied (learning-objectives, concept-scaffolding, code-example-generator, exercise-designer, assessment-builder, technical-clarity, book-scaffolding, ai-augmented-teaching)

Output: Complete lesson content written to the specified file path with all required sections and proper frontmatter.

**File Created**:
- `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorgpt-build/bbb/book-source/docs/03-Markdown-Prompt-Context-Engineering/09-markdown-language-of-ai/01-why-markdown-matters.md`

**Content Summary** (2100 words):
1. Opening Hook: Task list scenario showing importance of structure
2. What Is Markdown: Human-readable + machine-parseable explanation with filing system analogy
3. Structured Text Example: Plain text vs markdown comparison
4. Concept 1: Markdown as Structured Text (symbols, stability, AI implications)
5. Concept 2: AIDD Intent Layer (three-layer architecture with code examples)
6. Real-World Contexts: GitHub README, AI prompt engineering, documentation sites
7. Why This Matters: Five key reasons for learning markdown
8. Pause and Reflect: Discussion prompts
9. Try With AI: Two progressive prompts with expected outcomes and safety note

**YAML Frontmatter** (Complete):
- Title, description, chapter/lesson numbers, duration, proficiency level, concepts count
- Skills metadata: 2 skills (A1 proficiency) with CEFR levels, Bloom's levels, DigComp areas, measurable outcomes
- Learning objectives: 3 objectives aligned to A1/Remember-Understand levels with assessment methods
- Cognitive load: 2 new concepts (within A1 limit of 5) with analysis
- Differentiation: Extension for advanced + remedial for struggling students
- Generation metadata: 7 fields (generated_by, source_spec, created, last_modified, git_author, workflow, version)

**Constitutional Compliance**:
- ✓ Skills Proficiency Validation: A1 content with appropriate cognitive levels
- ✓ Cognitive Load: 2 concepts within A1 limit of 5
- ✓ Bloom's Taxonomy Alignment: Remember (identify) + Understand (explain) levels match A1
- ✓ Learning objectives: Measurable with appropriate verbs
- ✓ Concept scaffolding: Progressive from "what is markdown" to "AIDD Intent Layer"
- ✓ No "ask your AI" for foundational concepts: Book teaches markdown concept directly
- ✓ AI's role framed appropriately: "Learning WITH AI" not "learning FROM AI"
- ✓ Markdown structure: Valid, professional, grade 7-8 reading level
- ✓ Opening hook: Engaging Task List scenario (2 paragraphs)
- ✓ All factual claims include context/citations
- ✓ No gatekeeping language ("easy", "simple", "obvious")
- ✓ Pacing: ~7 minutes per major section (40-minute lesson target)
- ✓ Content breaks: Headings (H2/H3), bold emphasis, code blocks, bullet lists
- ✓ Single "Try With AI" closure: 2 progressive prompts, expected outcomes, safety note
- ✓ NO "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next" sections

**Domain Skills Applied**:
1. learning-objectives: 3 measurable objectives aligned to Bloom's/CEFR
2. concept-scaffolding: "What is markdown" → "Structured text symbols" → "AIDD Intent Layer" progression
3. code-example-generator: Plain text vs markdown example; AIDD layer code examples
4. exercise-designer: Not needed for A1 conceptual lesson; replaced with discussion prompts
5. assessment-builder: Comprehension check via "Pause and Reflect" questions
6. technical-clarity: Jargon explained (structured text, parsing, specification); analogies (filing system, layers)
7. book-scaffolding: Connects to Chapter 9 context (Markdown, Prompt & Context Engineering)
8. ai-collaborate-learning: "Try With AI" framed as partnership, not solution-seeking

**Validation Checklist**:

## Pedagogical Design Rationale

**Choice 1: Opening Hook (Task List Example)**
- Rationale: A1 students benefit from concrete scenarios before abstract concepts
- Execution: Shows real problem (unstructured vs structured) before explaining markdown
- Alternative rejected: Starting with definition ("Markdown is...") — too abstract

**Choice 2: Three Concepts Structure**
- Rationale: A1 limit is 5 new concepts; kept to 2 for cognitive safety
- Execution: (1) What markdown IS (structured text), (2) Why markdown MATTERS (AIDD Intent Layer)
- Alternative rejected: Adding syntax details in Lesson 1 — belongs in Lessons 2-5

**Choice 3: AIDD Intent Layer Explanation**
- Rationale: Teaches WHY markdown matters (not just WHAT it is); aligns with Constitution Principle 9 (AI-native thinking)
- Execution: Three-layer diagram with code examples
- Alternative rejected: Abstract explanation — students need concrete example

**Choice 4: Real-World Contexts (GitHub, AI, Docs)**
- Rationale: A1 learners need motivation; seeing markdown used everywhere increases buy-in
- Execution: Three concrete, familiar examples
- Alternative rejected: Toy examples — students need relevance

**Choice 5: ChatGPT Web in Try With AI**
- Rationale: This is Chapter 9, Part 3; no AI tools formally taught yet
- Execution: ChatGPT web (zero setup required)
- Note: Chapter 10+ will introduce Gemini CLI / Claude CLI and provide CLI variants

**Choice 6: Two Prompts in Try With AI**
- Rationale: First prompt is foundational ("Why?"), second is comparative (reinforces concept)
- Execution: Progressive complexity but both answerable with ChatGPT web
- Alternative rejected: Single prompt — insufficient for A1 validation

**Proficiency Design**:
- Lesson targets A1 (Foundation level) with Recognition/Identification focus
- No application required (that comes Lesson 2+)
- No synthesis or complex analysis (that comes Lesson 6+)
- Students should finish Lesson 1 able to: (1) Identify markdown's purpose, (2) Explain Intent Layer concept
