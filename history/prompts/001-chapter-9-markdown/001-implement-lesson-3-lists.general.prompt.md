## Prompt Text (Full User Request)

```
Implement Lesson 3: Lists - Organizing Ideas

Context:
- Chapter: 9 - Markdown: The Language of AI Communication
- Part: Part 3 - Markdown, Prompt & Context Engineering
- Lesson file: `book-source/docs/03-Markdown-Prompt-Context-Engineering/09-markdown-language-of-ai/03-lists-organizing-ideas.md`
- Spec: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorgpt-build/bbb/specs/001-chapter-9-markdown/spec.md`
- Plan: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorgpt-build/bbb/specs/001-chapter-9-markdown/plan.md`
- Tasks: Task T013-T015 from `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorgpt-build/bbb/specs/001-chapter-9-markdown/tasks.md`

Lesson Requirements:
- Duration: 40 minutes
- Proficiency Level: A2 (Basic application)
- Concepts: 3 (Moderate cognitive load)
- Skills Taught: Creating Unordered Lists (A2), Creating Ordered Lists (A2), Choosing List Type (A2)
- Teaching Tier: TIER 1 - Book teaches directly

Core Concepts (from tasks.md T013):
1. Unordered list syntax: `-` or `*` for bullet points
2. Ordered list syntax: `1.`, `2.`, `3.` for numbered steps
3. Selection principle: When to use bullets vs. numbers (unordered features vs sequential steps)

Content Requirements:
- Direct teaching: When to use unordered vs ordered lists
- Code Example 1: Feature list (unordered - no specific sequence)
- Code Example 2: Installation steps (ordered - must follow sequence)
- Code Example 3: Mixed markers error (inconsistent `-`, `*`, `+` - teach consistency)
- Exercise: Create feature list (unordered) and installation steps (ordered) for project
- Exercise template with scaffolding

Try With AI (Task T014):
- Student shares lists → asks ChatGPT "Are these lists clear? Should any be ordered instead of unordered?"
- AI validates student's choice of list type (teaches decision-making)

Assessment: Exercise template completion with both list types

YAML Frontmatter:
- All required fields: title, chapter, lesson, duration, proficiency, concepts
- Skills metadata with CEFR levels and Bloom's taxonomy
- Learning objectives aligned with A2
- Cognitive load assessment
- Generation metadata (source_spec, created, git_author, workflow, version)

Constitutional Requirements:
- Reading level: Grade 7-8
- Show both list syntaxes directly with examples
- Include common mistake: Mixed markers (`-`, `*`, `+` inconsistently)
- End with ONLY "Try With AI" section
- Apply all 8 domain skills
```

5. **assessment-builder**: 8-item validation checklist + AI prompts
6. **technical-clarity**: Jargon minimized, accessibility prioritized, semantic clarity
7. **book-scaffolding**: Connections to Lesson 2, foreshadows Lesson 4
8. **ai-collaborate-learning**: AI as validation partner, emphasizes human decision-making

### Validation Results

- ✅ All T013 content requirements met
- ✅ All T014 Try With AI requirements met
- ✅ All T015 exercise template requirements met
- ✅ YAML frontmatter complete and valid
- ✅ 3 concepts within A2 cognitive load limit
- ✅ All code examples tested for markdown correctness
- ✅ Lesson ends with ONLY "Try With AI" section
- ✅ Reading level appropriate for beginner audience
- ✅ Common mistakes explicitly addressed (Mistake 1: Mixed markers)
- ✅ No forced AI delegation (Tier 1 content taught directly)

---

## Key Decisions & Rationale

1. **Merged T015 Exercise into Practice Section**: Rather than a separate template file, integrated the exercise template directly into the Practice Exercise section of the lesson, making it more discoverable and contextual for students.

2. **Real-World Decision Framework**: Created a decision table (Concept 3) to help students learn semantic reasoning about when to choose list types, not just syntax memorization.

3. **Example Progression**: Sequenced examples from simple (2-item lists) to complex (specification with multiple sections), building confidence before assessment.

4. **Try With AI Prompts**: Designed 3 prompts that progress from shallow (clarity) to deep (implementation perspective), teaching students to validate their own work comprehensively.

5. **Common Mistakes Prioritization**: Included Mistake 1 (mixed markers) from task requirements, plus 4 additional mistakes addressing real cognitive errors students make (ordering confusion, spacing, context).

## Testing & Validation

### Manual Validation Performed

1. ✅ **File Creation**: Confirmed 03-lists-organizing-ideas.md created at correct path
2. ✅ **Line Count**: 568 lines (complete lesson)
3. ✅ **YAML Structure**: All required frontmatter fields present and valid
4. ✅ **Concepts**: 3 concepts (unordered syntax, ordered syntax, selection principle)
