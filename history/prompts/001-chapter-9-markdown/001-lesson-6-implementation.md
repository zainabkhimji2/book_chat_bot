## User Input Summary

**Implementation Request**:
> "Implement Lesson 6: Complex Markdown with AI Companion (Tier 2 Teaching Pattern) — Students have completed Lessons 1-5 (Tier 1) and can write basic markdown. This lesson introduces Tier 2: AI Companion handles complex syntax students shouldn't memorize. Requirements: Teach Tier 2 pattern explicitly, show 3 code examples (tables, nested lists, YAML), create 3 exercises with validation checklists, write 10-question quiz (SC-002), include supporting materials (validation checklist, AI response samples), end with 'Try With AI' section only (no key takeaways). Enforce all Constitutional principles (Graduated Teaching, Validation-First, Cognitive Load). Apply all 9 domain skills contextually. Output: Complete lesson markdown file + supporting materials files."

### Key Requirements Extracted
1. **Primary Content**: Lesson markdown file (06-complex-markdown-ai-companion.md)
2. **Teaching Pattern**: Tier 2 (Specify → Generate → Validate)
3. **Explicit Instruction**: Must teach WHY Tier 2 exists and WHEN to use it
4. **Concepts**: Exactly 3 (cognitive load constraint)
5. **Examples**: 3 required (table, nested list, YAML) with Spec → Output → Validation
6. **Exercises**: 3 required (progressive difficulty)
7. **Assessments**:
   - Inline: 5-question assessment with answers
   - Separate: 10-question quiz (SC-002 validation)
8. **Supporting Files**:
   - Validation checklist (3 checklists: tables, lists, YAML)
   - AI response samples (5 realistic examples with reading practice)
   - Quiz with answer key and feedback
9. **Closure**: ONLY "Try With AI" section (no "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next")
10. **Standards**:
    - YAML frontmatter with skills metadata (CEFR, Bloom's, DigComp)
    - Grade 7-8 reading level
    - Constitutional compliance (all 6 relevant principles)
    - All 9 domain skills applied contextually

---

## Implementation Approach

### Design Decisions

1. **Concept Ordering**: Tier 2 pattern → complex types → validation principle
   - Rationale: Mirrors the workflow students will follow; establishes mindset first

2. **Examples as Specifications**: Not runnable code, but request → output workflows
   - Rationale: Students aren't coding; they're requesting complex syntax. Follows Constitution Principle 9 (Show-Spec-Validate)

3. **Separate Checklist File**: Not inline with lesson
   - Rationale: Lesson focuses on concepts; checklist is a reference tool for repeated use

4. **5 Samples with Reading Practice**: Not minimal
   - Rationale: Reading AI responses is a new B1 skill; multiple patterns build confidence

5. **B1 Proficiency (Not A2)**:
   - Rationale: Students independently direct AI (Create level) and validate (Evaluate level); both B1

6. **ChatGPT Web for Try With AI**:
   - Rationale: Pre-tool chapter; ChatGPT web requires zero setup; note offers flexibility for students with tools

### Domain Skills Applied

1. **learning-objectives** ✓ — 3 measurable learning objectives with CEFR/Bloom's alignment
2. **concept-scaffolding** ✓ — Progressive complexity: pattern → types → validation

6. **technical-clarity** ✓ — Grade 7-8 reading level, jargon defined, clear explanations
7. **book-scaffolding** ✓ — Lesson positioned between Lesson 5 (Tier 1 foundation) and Lesson 7 (Tier 3 orchestration)
8. **ai-collaborate-learning** ✓ — Frames AI as "companion" for execution; emphasizes validation
9. (Skill 9 not required for markdown lessons) — Not applicable

## Constitutional Compliance Checklist

All 17 principles reviewed; relevant principles enforced:

### Principle 1: AI-First Teaching
- ✓ Every lesson includes "Try With AI" section
- ✓ Closure strategy: Single "Try With AI" only (no "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next")
- ✓ Frames AI as learning partner (specification directing, validation understanding)

### Principle 5: Progressive Complexity
- ✓ B1 proficiency level appropriate for Lesson 6 (after Lessons 1-5 A1/A2 foundation)
- ✓ Content assumes Tier 1 markdown knowledge
- ✓ Introduces Tier 2 pattern as natural progression

### Principle 9: Show-Spec-Validate (Specification-First)
- ✓ All 3 examples follow: Show specification → Show AI output → Show validation
- ✓ Teaches specification writing (core AIDD skill)
- ✓ Emphasizes clarity over syntax memorization

### Principle 12: Cognitive Load Management
- ✓ 3 new concepts (Tier 2 pattern, complex types, validation)
- ✓ Within B1 limit (max 10 concepts)
- ✓ Explicit tracking in YAML: `cognitive_load.new_concepts: 3`
- ✓ No gatekeeping language ("easy", "simple", "obvious")

### Principle 13: Graduated Teaching Pattern
- ✓ Tier 1 (Lessons 1-5): Book teaches markdown directly (students type manually)
- ✓ Tier 2 (Lesson 6): AI Companion for complex syntax
  - Students specify intent → AI generates syntax → Students validate
  - Does NOT ask students to memorize table pipes or YAML indentation
- ✓ Tier 3 (Lesson 7): AI Orchestration for scaling operations
- ✓ Explicit teaching: "Why Tier 2 Exists" and "When to Use Tier 2" sections

### Principle 15: Validation-Before-Trust (Validation-First Safety)
- ✓ Every example includes validation steps
- ✓ Every exercise includes validation checklist
- ✓ Entire "Validation Principle" concept dedicated to this
- ✓ Quiz questions test validation understanding
- ✓ Reading practice teaches validation through example
