## Prompt

```text
Now lets breakd it down into tasks using AI Native Teahcing Methadology
```

## Response snapshot

Generated 45 atomic tasks organized by user story using AI Native Teaching Methodology's three-tier pattern.

**45 tasks across 6 phases**:
- Setup: 3 tasks
- Foundational: 3 tasks (BLOCKING)
- US1 (Lessons 1-5): 16 tasks - Tier 1 teaching
- US2 (Lesson 6): 5 tasks - Tier 2 AI Companion
- US3 (Lessons 7-8): 9 tasks - Tier 3 Orchestration + Integration
- Polish: 9 tasks

**MVP scope**: 25 tasks (US1 only = students can write specifications)

**Three-tier enforcement**: Tasks explicitly require tier-specific teaching patterns in descriptions.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown ready for implementation
- 🧪 Tests: Format validation PASSED, User story organization PASSED, Success criteria mapping PASSED
- 📁 Files: tasks.md (574 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin implementation with lesson-writer subagent
- 🧠 Reflection: 45 atomic tasks organized by learning outcome. Three-tier pattern embedded in task requirements.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All validations PASSED
- Prompt variant (if applicable): AI Native Teaching Methodology central organizing principle
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate lesson content matches tier patterns in task descriptions
