## Prompt

System: Please continue.

## Response snapshot

I have created the implementation plan for 'Chapter 10: Context Engineering for AI-Driven Development'.

The plan is available at: `specs/010-context-engineering-chapter/plan.md`

The next step is to generate the tasks for the implementation. You can now proceed with `/sp.tasks` to create a detailed task list for the chapter.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a new implementation plan for a book chapter.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 1 file created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of creating the plan was smooth. The provided context was clear and sufficient.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a
