## Prompt

System: Please continue.

## Response snapshot

I have clarified the specification for 'Chapter 10: Context Engineering for AI-Driven Development'.

I asked 2 questions and updated the specification based on your answers.

The updated specification is available at: `specs/010-context-engineering-chapter/spec.md`

The sections touched were: `Clarifications`, `Edge Cases`.

All critical ambiguities have been resolved. You can now proceed with `/sp.implement` to start writing the chapter content.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Clarified the feature specification for a book chapter.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 1 file modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: The clarification process was successful in resolving the ambiguities in the spec.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a
