## Prompt

Use Chapter planner agent to design plan

## Response snapshot

Successfully invoked **chapter-planner** subagent to transform the approved Chapter 4 specification into a comprehensive implementation plan.

**Plan Created**: `specs/004-chapter-4-nine-pillars/plan.md` (289 lines)

**Key Planning Decisions:**

1. **Chapter Architecture**: 7 progressive sections
   - Section 1: Why This Moment Demands a New Paradigm (establish AIDD as system)
   - Section 2: AIDD Defined (clear, memorable definition)
   - Section 3: The Nine Pillars Overview (introduce all nine as integrated system)
   - Section 4: The Nine Pillars Detailed (deep dive each pillar)
   - Section 5: The M-Shaped Developer (multi-domain expertise enabled by AIDD)
   - Section 6: Why All Nine Matter (competitive necessity without panic)
   - Section 7: Journey Ahead (forward momentum to Chapters 5+)

2. **Content Type**: Conceptual/narrative (not technical)
   - No code examples or coding exercises
   - Heavy storytelling (5-8 examples), historical context (3-5 comparisons), thought experiments
   - Reflection prompts instead of coding problems
   - Grade 7 reading level with terminology explained

3. **Scaffolding Strategy** (Part 1 Heavy Support):
   - Concrete before abstract (stories before pillars)
   - Repetition with variation (consistent pillar structure)
   - Progressive complexity (simple → complex relationships)
   - Cognitive load management (nine pillars digestible)

4. **Content Enrichment Patterns** (All 7 Applied):
   - Rich storytelling (5-8 examples throughout)
   - Historical context (3-5 comparisons: cloud, Agile, DevOps, mobile-first)
   - Thought experiments (1-2 per section)
   - Skepticism addressing (evidence-based responses)
   - Personal relevance (self-assessment, positioning)
   - Comparison tables (2-3 visual comparisons)
   - Forward momentum (strong transitions)

5. **Integration Strategy**:
   - **Backward** (builds on Chapters 1-3): AI as partner → comprehensive methodology
   - **Forward** (prepares for 5+): Maps each pillar to future chapters

**Tasks Created**: `specs/004-chapter-4-nine-pillars/tasks.md` (229 lines)

**Task Phases**:
- Phase 1: Content Structure (7 tasks) - Section drafts, pillar templates
- Phase 2: Content Enrichment (5 tasks) - Stories, historical context, thought experiments
- Phase 3: Pedagogical Review (3 tasks) - Scaffolding, accessibility, factual accuracy
- Phase 4: Final Polish (3 tasks) - Tone, transitions, constitution alignment

**Estimated Effort**: 15-23 hours total

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete lesson-by-lesson architecture ready for content creation. Plan provides clear structure for seven sections with scaffolding strategy, content enrichment patterns, and integration points. Tasks checklist breaks implementation into 18 actionable tasks across 4 phases.
- 🧪 Tests: Plan structure validated (7 sections, progressive complexity). Tasks validated (4 phases, MUST/SHOULD priorities, clear acceptance criteria). Constitutional alignment confirmed (Principles 1, 5, 6, 8).
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md (289 lines) and tasks.md (229 lines) in specs/004-chapter-4-nine-pillars/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for content creation using lesson-writer subagent. Can proceed section-by-section following plan.md and checking off tasks.md items.
- 🧠 Reflection: chapter-planner agent executed flawlessly. Key strength: transformed abstract "nine pillars" concept into concrete 7-section narrative structure with clear learning progression. The decision to separate "overview" (Section 3) from "detailed" (Section 4) prevents cognitive overload. Integration strategy (backward to 1-3, forward to 5+) ensures chapter fits cohesively in book flow.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Subagent successfully created both plan.md and tasks.md with appropriate structure and detail.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Structure validation PASS (7 sections with clear progression). Content enrichment PASS (all 7 patterns included). Tasks validation PASS (4 phases, actionable items, acceptance criteria). Constitutional alignment PASS (Principles 1, 5, 6, 8 embedded).
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Used chapter-planner subagent per user request "Use Chapter planner agent to design plan"
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider whether Section 4 (The Nine Pillars Detailed) should be split into 2-3 sections to reduce length, or if keeping all nine pillars together maintains conceptual cohesion better. Current plan assumes single detailed section works for narrative flow.
