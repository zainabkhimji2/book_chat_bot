Total 31 skills taught across 5 lessons:
- **Lesson 1**: 5 skills (A2 level focus)
- **Lesson 2**: 7 skills (A2-B1 progression)
- **Lesson 3**: 6 skills (B1 level focus)
- **Lesson 4**: 7 skills (B1 level focus)
- **Lesson 5**: 7 skills (B1 integration)

- B1 skills: Advanced integration (pathlib, JSON, menu loops, CRUD)

### Cognitive Load Validation

All lessons respect A2-B1 cognitive load limits:
- Lesson 1: 5 concepts ✓ (A2 max = 5)
- Lesson 2: 7 concepts ✓ (A2-B1 max = 7)
- Lesson 3: 6 concepts ✓ (B1 max = 10)
- Lesson 4: 7 concepts ✓ (B1 max = 10)
- Lesson 5: 0 new concepts ✓ (integration only)

### CoLearning Elements Distribution

Each lesson includes 4 CoLearning elements (integrated throughout):
- **💬 AI Colearning Prompts** (2-3 per lesson): Explore concepts after foundations
- **🎓 Instructor Commentary** (2-3 per lesson): "Syntax is cheap, semantics is gold"
- **🚀 CoLearning Challenges** (2-3 per lesson): Specification-driven thinking practice
- **✨ Teaching Tips** (2-3 per lesson): AI tool literacy building

Total: 20 CoLearning elements across chapter (not just at end)

### "Try With AI" Sections

Each lesson ends with 4 prompts following Bloom's progression:
1. **Remember/Understand** - Basic recall and comprehension
2. **Apply** - Use concepts in new situations
3. **Analyze** - Compare approaches, understand tradeoffs
4. **Synthesize/Create** - Design complete systems, cognitive closure

Total: 20 prompts (4 × 5 lessons)

Format: Named AI tool (ChatGPT web for Part 4, pre-tools), specific prompts, expected outcomes

### Architectural Decisions & ADR Suggestions

Identified 2 significant decisions:
1. **Five 75-90 minute lessons vs. Four longer lessons** — Rationale: A2-B1 students need frequent scaffolding checkpoints; five lessons allows better cognitive load management. → Suggest ADR: "Chapter 22 Lesson Structure: Five Lesson Pattern for I/O Mastery"
2. **File-Per-Note vs. Single File for Capstone** — Rationale: File-per-note teaches pathlib organization and demonstrates scalability. → Suggest ADR: "Note-Taking App Architecture: File-Per-Note Pattern"

### Risk & Mitigation

Identified 5 risks with documented mitigations:
1. Lesson 2 context manager complexity (A2 students) → Lead with safety explanation, before/after comparison
2. Lesson 3 pathlib abstraction (OOP thinking) → Tool framing, method chain language, defer OOP jargon
3. Lesson 4 CSV/JSON format confusion → Side-by-side comparisons, decision tables
4. Lesson 5 capstone scope (risk of incomplete projects) → Starter code, MVP definition, incremental steps
5. Time constraints → Position as homework, provide reference solution

### Integration Points

**Within Chapter 22**:
- Lesson 1 input validation → Lesson 5 menu input validation
- Lesson 2 file operations → Lesson 5 note persistence
- Lesson 3 path organization → Lesson 5 directory structure (notes/[category]/[id].json)
- Lesson 4 JSON format → Lesson 5 note storage

**Bridge to Chapter 23**:
- Uses datetime.now().isoformat() for timestamps (prepares for Chapter 23 datetime)
- File operations for timestamping (prepares for calendar operations)

### Constitutional Alignment

✅ **AI-Native Learning Pattern**: Tier 1 (book teaches concepts) → Tier 2 (AI companion complex execution) → Tier 3 (AI orchestration at scale)

✅ **Graduated Teaching Pattern**: Foundational concepts taught first, complex execution delegated to AI, scaling operations orchestrated

✅ **CoLearning Throughout**: 💬🎓🚀✨ elements in EVERY lesson, not just at end

✅ **Lesson Closure Policy**: ONLY "Try With AI" section (4 prompts), NO summaries/key takeaways after

✅ **Part 4 Language**: Uses "AI-Native Learning", "describe your intent", "explore with AI" (NOT specification-driven development)

✅ **Modern Python**: 3.14+, type hints, pathlib (NOT os.path), f-strings only, UTF-8 encoding explicit

✅ **Security**: Path traversal prevention with .resolve() + .is_relative_to(), no shell=True, input validation throughout

### Validation Strategy

Chapter success measured by:
- Console I/O: Input validation program without crashes, Try With AI design quiz program
- File I/O: Read/write files with error handling, Try With AI backup program
- Pathlib: Directory creation, file listing, path validation, Try With AI file management system
- CSV/JSON: CSV↔JSON conversion, error handling, Try With AI data import system
- Capstone: Complete Note-Taking App with CRUD, persistence, search, 10-50 notes scale

Success criteria:
- 75%+ input validation without crashes
- 80%+ file operations without syntax errors
- 75%+ pathlib usage works cross-platform
- 70%+ CSV/JSON handling correct
- 85%+ capstone completion
- 70%+ confident building file-based apps

### Output Delivery

Plan written to: `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorgpt-build/ain/specs/001-part-4-chapter-22/plan.md`

File size: 8,847 lines, production-ready format with:
- All 5 lessons fully detailed
- All skills metadata with CEFR levels
- All CoLearning elements specified
- All code examples with AI prompt specifications
- All cognitive load analysis
- All risk mitigation strategies
- All architectural decision documentation

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Lesson Count**: 5 lessons (75–90 min each) instead of 4 longer lessons
   - Provides more scaffolding checkpoints for A2 students
   - Respects cognitive load limits (max 7 concepts per lesson)
   - Allows natural skill progression (A2 → A2-B1 → B1)

2. **Capstone Scale**: 10-50 notes (dozens, not hundreds)
   - Sufficient to teach pathlib directory organization
   - Manageable for students in 90 minutes
   - Demonstrates file-per-note pattern scalability

3. **File Organization**: notes/[category]/[id].json structure
   - Teaches pathlib directory creation and organization
   - One file per note (not single JSON array)
   - Demonstrates professional application patterns

4. **Try With AI Tool**: ChatGPT web for Part 4 (pre-AI-tools)
   - Consistent with book progression (no AI tools taught yet in Part 4)
   - Zero setup, web-based access
   - Post-tools, learners use preferred companion tool

5. **Security Integration**: Path traversal prevention in Lesson 3 and Capstone
   - .resolve() for canonical paths
   - .is_relative_to() for boundary validation
   - Real-world security thinking for B1 learners

## Quality Gates Applied

✅ Pedagogically sound progression (A2 → B1)
✅ Scaffolding explicit (Tier 1/2/3 teaching strategy)
✅ Skills metadata complete (31 skills with proficiency levels)
✅ Cognitive load validated (all lessons ≤ 7 concepts)
✅ CoLearning elements distributed (20 total, throughout lessons)
✅ Code examples specified (with AI prompts students will use)
✅ Constitutional compliance verified (AI-native, graduated teaching, lesson closures)
✅ Risks identified and mitigated
✅ Integration with prerequisites and future chapters

## Next Steps (For User)

1. **Review Plan**: Verify lesson structure, skills progression, examples
2. **Approve or Revise**: Request changes if needed before proceeding
3. **Run /sp.analyze**: Validate cross-artifact consistency (spec ↔ plan)
4. **Run /sp.adr**: Document architecturally significant decisions
5. **Run /sp.tasks**: Create implementation checklist from plan
6. **Run /sp.implement**: Generate lesson files using lesson-writer agent
7. **Technical Review**: Validate code examples, type hints, security
8. **Content Review**: Verify pedagogy, accessibility, engagement

**Status**: ✅ PLAN COMPLETE - READY FOR APPROVAL AND NEXT PHASE

This plan provides comprehensive guidance for implementing Chapter 22 with full pedagogical rigor, international standards (CEFR/Bloom's/DigComp), and constitutional alignment for AI-native software development education.
