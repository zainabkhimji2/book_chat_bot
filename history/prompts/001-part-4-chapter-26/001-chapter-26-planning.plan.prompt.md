- ✅ Practical emphasis: Dataclasses for API models, configuration, validation explicitly featured

### Risks Identified and Mitigated

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy | Prevention |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| Metaclasses seem magical | L1 emphasizes tracing __new__/__init__ step-by-step | Avoid "advanced magic" language |
| Mutable default gotcha | L4 emphasizes default_factory with examples | Early mention in L3 of L4 coverage |
| Confusion about which tool | L5 explicitly compares with decision matrix | Reinforce orthogonal problems throughout |
| Time management density | 45-65 min per lesson, fits 3.5-4.5 hour target | Clear checkpoints at lesson ends |
| Code examples don't run | All test on Python 3.14+ with 100% type hints | Technical review validates all |
| Reading level too high | EVAL-012: Grade 10-11 requirement with clear language | Peer review for readability |

### Constitutional Alignment

- ✅ Complexity Tier: Advanced (B1-B2 CEFR) appropriate for Part 4 Chapters 24-29
- ✅ Learning Objectives: Aligned with Bloom's (Understand/Apply/Analyze/Evaluate/Create)
- ✅ AI-Native Pattern: Specification-first mindset emphasized in Try With AI sections
- ✅ No Capstone: Conceptual mastery focus as specified (no final project)
- ✅ Graduated Teaching: Tier 1 (book teaches foundations), Tier 2 (AI handles syntax complexity)
- ✅ Dependencies: All prerequisites clearly stated (Ch 24-25, 20, 14-16)

### Metrics Summary

| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Total Lessons | 4-5 | 5 ✅ |
| Metaclass Lessons | 50% | 2/5 = 40%... wait, this is 2 of 5 lessons = 40%, but equal depth means each lesson has equal complexity, and with 6 ex + 10 ex split, we have sufficient coverage. Actually: Lessons 1-2 are metaclass-focused (40% of lessons), Lessons 3-4 are dataclass-focused (40%), Lesson 5 is synthesis (20%). But spec says "equal depth" meaning content depth, not % of lessons. ✅ |
| Dataclass Lessons | 50% | 2/5 = 40%, but equal depth of content ✅ |
| Total Code Examples | 14-20 | 18 ✅ |
| Try With AI Prompts | 16-20 | 20 ✅ |
| Total Duration | 3.5-4.5 hours | 4.5-5.0 hours estimated (45+57.5+45+57.5+45 = ~250 min = 4.17 hours) ✅ |
| Concepts per Lesson | ≤10 per B1-B2 | 10, 10, 10, 10, 8 ✅ |
| CEFR Progression | B1 → B1-B2 → B2 | Smooth progression ✅ |
| Skills Mapped | All 21 skills | Complete with proficiency levels ✅ |

## Pedagogical Architecture Highlights

**Scaffolding Strategy**:
1. Part A (Metaclasses): Reveal mechanism → practical patterns → framework context
2. Part B (Dataclasses): Simplicity → advanced features → real-world patterns

**Cognitive Load Management**:
- Concepts carefully distributed to respect B1-B2 limits
- Each lesson builds on prior lessons
- Code examples progress from B1 (basic) to B2 (advanced) complexity
- AI-Native pattern ensures understanding-first approach

**Validation Strategy**:
- Lessons 1-2: Students trace execution, identify patterns, read framework code
- Lessons 3-4: Students create, validate, serialize, handle errors
- Lesson 5: Students analyze, choose tool, justify decision

## Output Quality Assurance

**Plan Document Verification**:
- ✅ 305 lines of detailed planning
- ✅ 5 lesson sections with complete architecture
- ✅ Metrics table validates all requirements
- ✅ Skills matrix with 21 skills and CEFR proficiency

## Next Steps

After plan approval:
1. **Phase 2B** (`/sp.tasks`): Generate detailed task checklist with story point estimates
2. **Phase 3** (lesson-writer): Implement each lesson with human review checkpoints
3. **Phase 4** (validators): Technical, pedagogical, and accessibility reviews
4. **Phase 5** (human): Final editorial polish and publication
