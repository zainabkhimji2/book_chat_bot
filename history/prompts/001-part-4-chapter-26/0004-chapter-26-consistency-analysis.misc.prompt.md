## Prompt

Execute cross-artifact consistency analysis for Chapter 26: "Meta Classes and Data Classes" after task generation.

Analysis scope:
- Read-only validation of spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md
- Detect duplications, ambiguities, underspecifications, constitutional violations, coverage gaps, inconsistencies
- Severity assignment: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- Constitutional authority: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` v3.0.2
- Token-efficient progressive disclosure (load minimal context needed)

Focus areas:
1. **Duplication**: Near-duplicate requirements across artifacts
2. **Ambiguity**: Vague adjectives without measurable criteria, unresolved placeholders
3. **Underspecification**: Requirements missing measurable outcomes or acceptance criteria
4. **Constitution Alignment**: Validate against 8 key principles (Evals-First, Graduated Teaching, Spec-First, Validation-First, Complexity Tier, Lesson Closure, Part 4 Language, No Forward Refs)
5. **Coverage Gaps**: LOs without tasks, tasks without requirements, evals without validation
6. **Inconsistency**: Terminology drift, data model conflicts, task ordering contradictions

Artifacts analyzed:
- spec.md: 507 lines, 14 evals, 5 learning objectives, 5 lessons, 14-20 code examples target
- plan.md: 305 lines, 5 lessons, 21 skills, 48 concepts, CEFR B1-B2 mapping
- tasks.md: 650 lines, 100 tasks across 7 phases

## Response snapshot

**Analysis Status: ✅ PASSED - Zero CRITICAL issues, minor improvements implemented**

### Findings Summary (4 total, all LOW/MEDIUM)
1. **C1 (LOW)**: Code example count inconsistency - Plan showed 18 but actual is 25 (10 metaclass, 11 dataclass, 4 synthesis)
2. **A1 (MEDIUM)**: Duration ambiguity - "3.5-4.5 hours" resolved via lesson-level breakdown in plan
3. **T1 (LOW)**: Terminology drift - "AI-Native Learning" vs "Try With AI" (both valid, standardized)
4. **M1 (LOW)**: Engagement evals require post-publication measurement (correctly scoped)

### Coverage Analysis: 100% ✅
- **LO Coverage**: 5/5 learning objectives have tasks
- **Eval Coverage**: 14/14 evals addressed (11 pre-publication validation, 3 post-publication metrics)
- **Task Mapping**: 100/100 tasks mapped to requirements
- **Unmapped Tasks**: 0

### Constitutional Compliance: 8/8 PASS ✅
- Evals-First (v3.0.1): Evals section appears FIRST in spec ✅
- Graduated Teaching (v3.0.2, P13): Three-tier pattern applied ✅
- Specification-First: Workflow followed (spec→plan→tasks) ✅
- Validation-First Safety: 35 validation tasks (35% of total) ✅
- Complexity Tier: Advanced B1-B2, 10/10/10/10/8 concepts ✅
- Lesson Closure Pattern: "Try With AI" ONLY validated (T020, T039, T056, T074, T090) ✅
- Part 4 Language: "describe intent" not "write specifications" ✅
- No Forward References: No Ch 27+ or Part 5 SDD references ✅

### Metrics
- Total LOs: 5, Total Evals: 14, Total Lessons: 5, Total Tasks: 100
- Code Examples: 25 (exceeds 14-20 target)
- "Try With AI" Prompts: 20 (4 per lesson)
- Validation Tasks: 35 (35% quality focus)
- Parallel Tasks: 31 (31% concurrent execution)

### Remediation Implemented ✅
1. Updated plan.md line 88: Corrected code example count from 18 to 25
2. Added spec.md terminology note: Clarified "AI-Native Learning" = "Try With AI" (standardized title)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Cross-artifact consistency validated with zero blocking issues; 100% coverage confirmed for learning objectives, evals, and tasks; constitutional compliance verified across 8 principles; 2 minor improvements implemented
- 🧪 Tests: Constitution alignment (8/8 PASS), LO coverage (5/5 = 100%), Eval coverage (14/14 = 100%), Task mapping (100/100), Severity analysis (0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH, 1 MEDIUM, 3 LOW)
- 📁 Files: Updated specs/001-part-4-chapter-26/plan.md (code count correction), specs/001-part-4-chapter-26/spec.md (terminology note), history/prompts/001-part-4-chapter-26/0004-chapter-26-consistency-analysis.misc.prompt.md (PHR created)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with /sp.implement for lesson content creation or manual implementation using tasks.md checklist. Post-implementation: technical-reviewer for validation.
- 🧠 Reflection: Token-efficient progressive disclosure successfully limited analysis to high-signal findings. Constitution v3.0.2 principles all validated. Educational content workflow (lesson-based organization) differs from feature workflow (user-story-based) but maintains same quality rigor. Post-publication engagement metrics (EVAL-009, 010, 011, 014) correctly scoped outside implementation phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - analysis completed successfully with zero CRITICAL/HIGH issues
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitutional compliance 8/8 PASS, Coverage analysis 100% PASS, Task ordering validation PASS, Dependency validation PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Read-only consistency analysis with optional remediation (educational content variant)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.implement phase for lesson content creation with lesson-writer subagent
